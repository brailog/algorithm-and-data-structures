It enables you to experience the feel of free weights with the safety of a
smith machine. The Caribou
III contains the most advanced smith carriage available today. Oilite bushings glide over solid chrome rods providing a piston-like action unmatched by any square carriage. This special carriage is locked instantly into any of the safety catches by a quick turn of the wrist. The new Caribou III features dual bar holders and safety rail spotter arms. On the contrary, strong muscles are neccessary in order to stay young. It is only by
this type of training that fat can be burnt and you can acheive stronger muscles. Toned muscles protect the joints, tendons and ligaments from tears and strains. Individual muscle parts can be targeted for training as the movement is guided by the machine, and workout stations can be utilised according to your personal needs. The correct choice of training weight and proper execution of the exercises will help you to achieve your personal objective. There are many options available, and nearly all systems have their own weight stack, and some with
pulley systems that can multiply the resistance of the weights you are lifting. Most basic machines include chest press, pec-dec, leg curl/extension, and lat pulldown workout stations, but many additional features can be found to suit your needs. With certain ranges of multigyms, there are "add-ons" available which can be purchased with the basic machine, or added later. Please note delivered items may incur a charge.

Need to exercise but hate gyms?

The problem is: how can you find an enjoyable exercise routine that doesn't involve going to a gym? Well, you can, by joining a local "Green Gym" - physical activity through gardening and local environment improvement.   Endorsed by local health services, including doctors and nurses who recommend people to take part in a Green Gym, participants plant trees, grow food on allotments and create nature areas. Currently there are over 80 Green
Gyms in the UK run entirely
by volunteers, and you can join in for a minimum of three hours a week throughout the year.   And the benefits of joining Green Gym are not just physical.

The recalled fitness machines are the Bowflex
Power Pro with and without a "Lat Tower" and Ultimate models built before September 1, 2002. The "Lat Tower" attaches to the back of the bench, and has pull-down pulleys attached. The name "Bowflex" and the model name are printed on the front of the machines. Remedy: Consumers should stop using the incline support mechanism and contact Bowflex to receive a free repair kit.

for a repair kit, as they will receive one automatically.

In the words of one Green Gym participant: “Since becoming disabled I have been looking for a way to contribute toward the community, with
the Green Gym I have been able to do this and help the environment as well - two for the price of one”   Green Gyms were developed by a Dr. William Bird in 1997 as part of  the British Trust of Conservation Volunteers - now known simply as BCTV - a charity established in 1959, with a successful history of environmental conservation volunteering throughout the UK and around the world.  Each Green Gym project is established by a local partnership involving BTCV, the local
authority (local council), local health service and other community and voluntary organisations.   Most are initially organised and managed by a BTCV ‘Project Officer', whose role is to facilitate local community involvement and provide training, support and guidance to community members, with the expectation that after 2 years the group will be self-directed by local volunteers. BTCV has just launched a ‘School Green Gym’, where
children who don’t take enough
exercise, including overweight children, can take part in the Gym as an after-school club or physical education lesson.
