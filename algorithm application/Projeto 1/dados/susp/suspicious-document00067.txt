Even more, they need to be motivated not only to accept change but also to become agents of change among their own people.What are their needs? In the spiritual arena, there are no Christian resources available to the Bengkulu. In addition, Bengkulu City authorities refuse to give permission for the construction of Christian church buildings within the city limits. House churches are stoned, pastors are intimidated, and leaders are murdered. When Stamford Raffles held the torch That cast Promethean Flame We faced the challenge of the day To give our school a name The eagle eye and gryphon strength They led us to the fore To reign supreme in ev'ry sphere The sons of Singapore Come heed the call Rafflesians all And let our hearts be stirring We'll do our best whateer the test And keep our colours flying Let

After two and a half years of faithful restoration, Raffles Hotel reopened in 1991 featuring 103 suites, each tastefully appointed with period furnishings and modern convenience to cater to every discerning traveller. Banquet Menu from the Centenary of the Evacuation of New York City, 1883 Although its significance has long since faded from public memory, November 25th was once widely celebrated in New York City as Evacuation Day. In 1783, it marked the departure of the last British
troops from American soil and George Washington's victorious return to the city that had been occupied since 1776. Raffles Hotel Singapore is an iconic landmark of Singapore colonial past. The luxurious Raffles is located in the colonial core of Singapore and has long been famous for its decadence and history. Restored to the style to which it was once accustomed, Raffles has 103 suites each with its own spacious parlour, bedroom and dressing area. The suites are opulent with fourteen-foot high ceilings, timber floors, oriental carpets and period style furnishings. His concept of "restorative foods" is therefore rather decadent, on the menu you'll find fabulous "fusion" dishes that are more flavorful than medicinal. Guest chefs make the menu ever changing -- the latest and greatest, a trio of beef cuts prepared in three different styles (Western, Indian, and Chinese) on the same plate, or the unique and mouthwatering Sichuan rack
of lamb. The house wine is a Riesling
(sweet wines are more popular with Singaporeans) from Raffles's own vineyard.
