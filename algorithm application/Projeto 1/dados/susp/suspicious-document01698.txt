The asbestos rock is mined and then crushed to produce the material we know as asbestos. Asbestos fibers are categorized as (curly fibers) or (straight fibers). Chrysotile asbestos is classified as serpentine. Amosite,
anthophyllite, crocidolite, tremolite, and actinolite are classified as amphiboles.Asbestosserpentinesamphiboles Use of asbestos became popular near the end of the 19th century due to its resistance to heat, electricity, and chemicals and its use continued through the 1970s. Due to the typically long latency period of
diseases caused by asbestos exposure it is often very difficult to find effective treatment options for those diagnosed. In most cases asbestos-related diseases are already in their advanced stages of development by the
time that they are discovered.

good cells as well as cancer cells, patients taking Cisplatin may experience side effects. As with any medication, patients are smart to report any potential side
effects to a doctor immediately. Cisplatin is often used in combination with Alimta. Patients taking Cisplatin in combination with Alimta have longer

Most patients have pain for the first few days after surgery. Cancer pain can be controlled with medicine, and patients should discuss pain relief with the doctor or nurse. Also, after lung cancer surgery, air and fluid tend to collect in the chest. Patients often need help turning over, coughing, and breathing deeply. These activities are important for recovery because they help expand the remaining lung tissue and get rid of excess air and fluid. Pain or weakness in the chest and the arm, and shortness of breath are common side effects
of lung cancer surgery. Patients may need several weeks or months to regain their energy and strength. lung cancer   For more information about

Mesothelioma Treatments Medical professionals are constantly researching advances in mesothelioma treatment programs to better serve individuals suffering from the asbestos-caused cancer. There are several factors that help determine the most effective mesothelioma treatment program for each individual patient, including the stage of the cancer, how far the cancer has spread, and the age and overall health of the patient.

incidence was not clear because
of high mortality. A special protective lubricating fluid that allows organs to move around is produced by the mesothelium. This protective fluid helps the lungs to move without resistance inside the chest cavity while breathing. The medical name for the mesothelium of the chest is the pleura and the medical name for the mesothelium of the abdomen is the peritoneum. The mesothelium of the "sac-like" space around the heart is called the pericardium. A malignant (cancerous) tumor of the mesothelium is
called a malignant mesothelioma. As most mesothelial tumors are cancerous, malignant mesothelioma is often simply called mesothelioma. Tumors of
the mesothelium can also be benign (noncancerous) but benign mesotheliomas are much more rare.

Another early account of asbestos use was in the wick of a golden lamp crafted for the goddess Athena in the fourth to fifth centuries B.C. During
this same period,
asbestos cloth was used to hold the ashes of the dead
during cremation. Pliny has
also described the use of asbestos cloth
as a funeral dress for kings. Emperor Charlemagne reportedly displayed a tablecloth made from
asbestos that was used during great feasts. After the feast, the cloth and its contents would be thrown into a fire, and the cloth would be
removed without damage to the amazement
of the guests. Scientists have conducted more studies like this in other regions of the United States and around the world. Many of these studies have
demonstrated an association
between
residential exposure to radon and
lung cancer, but this finding has not
been observed in all studies. The inconsistencies between studies are due in part to the small size of some studies, the varying levels of radon in many homes,
and the difficulty of measuring a person's exposure to radon over time.   Researchers have combined and analyzed data from all radon studies conducted in Canada and the United States. By combining the data from these studies, scientists were able to analyze data from thousands of people.

lung Friable asbestos is asbestos that has gotten old or has been in some way destroyed or damaged so that it now produces dangerous asbestos dust. The tiny fibers in the dust
circulate throughout the air and may be inhaled by anyone in the vicinity. Unfortunately, the fibers are sharp and easily embed themselves in the lungs or mesothelium of those exposed, ventually causing scarring and perhaps cancer. For many years, asbestos was used in myriad industries and products because of its extraordinary heat- and fire-resistant properties. Because of that, its common to encounter asbestos in old homes or commercial buildings, where it may be found in the walls, floors, and

other life threatening diseases. In the 1960s the toxicity of products that contain asbestos finally became widely acknowledged, but it wasn't until 1970 that federal laws started to limit the many uses of asbestos. Even

REMOVAL - WHERE ARE WE? Within 20 years of the first factory production of asbestos, the public health hazards associated with asbestos started to come to light. Despite the fact that New Jersey has been the site of many asbestos industries, there appears to be a dramatic under-utilization of the workers' compensation
system for recovery. An unfortunate legacy of asbestos-related disease is likely to remain a problem of huge proportions not only for New Jersey's Workers' Compensation System, but also for the nation as a whole for many years to come. Asbestos fiber still remains prevalent in work environments throughout the nation.
Equipment containing asbestos remains in
use, and buildings containing asbestos fiber will require maintenance, repair, encapsulation and/or removal. The long latency periods for asbestos-related disease further complicate estimated projections for the future. 5 Paul MacAvoy of Yale University Whether these treatment options will be available to a mesothelioma patient will depend on several factors including the age of the patient, the staging of the cancer and
the overall health of the
mesothelioma victim. Your
doctor will be in the best position to determine whether
you or your loved one is a good candidate for any of these procedures. We have provided a brief list and synopsis of these procedures in order that the mesothelioma patient can familiarize themselves with them and be in a
position to make the best informed decision on your cancer treatment. ALIMTA A mesothelioma patient should request information on Alimta. The automotive industry uses it in vehicle brake shoes and clutch pads.   More than 5,000 products contain or have contained asbestos.   Government regulations and other actions, coupled with widespread public concern about the hazards of asbestos, have resulted in a significant annual decline in U.S. use of asbestos. Domestic consumption amounted to about 719,000
metric tons in 1973, but it had dropped to about 9,000 metric tons by 2002. Asbestos is currently used most frequently in gaskets and in roofing and friction products.   Health Risks Associated With Exposure Exposure to asbestos may increase the risk of several serious diseases, including: With our nationwide branch

Information and news about asbestos, mesothelioma, and legal compensation claims.   For Immediate Assistance Call: (800) 426-9535       Diseases Associated with Asbestos Malignant Mesothelioma Malignant mesothelioma is
a rare form of cancer affecting the sac lining the chest or abdomen. It typically develops 20 or more years after initial exposure to airborne asbestos. It can be contracted with as little as one or two months of asbestos exposure. Family members of asbestos workers can also develop this disease as a result of contact with contaminated work clothes. Documents reveal that asbestos manufacturers were aware of the health
risks related to exposure to asbestos
from the 1940s and 1950s, but concealed
this information from their employees. In the 1970s, the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) began to regulate asbestos. Today workers are protected from exposure to asbestos as a result of very strict regulations and enforcement.    Amosite, Crocidolite, Chrysotile While in operation, the mine in Libby produced most of the worlds supply of vermiculite. Vermiculite has been used in building insulation, potting soil and fertilizer. Unfortunately, the vermiculite from the Libby mine contained a
type of naturally-occurring asbestos called tremolite-actinolite. How can I be exposed to asbestos in vermiculite? Not all vermiculite contains asbestos; however, some products
have been made with vermiculite containing asbestos. People can be exposed to asbestos by breathing
or ingesting it. It was Dr.
Murray's prediction that since
the hazards of this exposure were now known, very few similar cases would occur in the future, and
there was no need to provide compensation benefits. 2 In 1924, Dr. Cooke in England reported the case of a woman who died of severe lung scarring In 1924, Dr. While at SimmonsCooper LLC and The Simmons Law Firm, Marcus Raichle's experience included representing the plaintiff in the largest single mesothelioma verdict in the United States; a $250 million verdict against U.S. Steel. His experience also includes a $34
million verdict and countless large settlements in mesothelioma cases.EXPERIENCE     Deciding who should represent you and your case is one of the most critically important
decisions that you might ever make, and could mean the
difference between success and
failure. You need, and are
entitled
to, an experienced
mesothelioma attorney who has a track record of success in mesothelioma lawsuits on your side
through the entire
claim process. Some studies have indicated that among patients whose mesothelioma is revealed early and treated aggressively, about half will have a life expectancy of two years, and one-fifth will have a life expectancy of five years. Among patients whose mesothelioma is advanced, only five percent
can expect to live another five years. Get Examined, Mesothelioma Diagnosis  The importance of cannot be overemphasized. If you worked with asbestos at some point in your life, or if you were exposed to a significant amount
of asbestos in a non-work setting,
you should see a
physician about the possibility of mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases , even if you have not had
any
symptoms. If you
wait
until you are experiencing the ,
you're missing a chance to
catch the disease at an early
stage. Many other
industrialized nations have banned asbestos including the European Union and a handful of other
countries, such as Chile, Croatia,
Australia, Argentina, and Saudi Arabia. Several countries, especially those who continue to make money from the mining of
asbestos,
consistently fight against asbestos bans. A few current U.S. senators, with the assistance of asbestos watchdog groups, hope to encourage the government to reconsider a ban on all asbestos products. A new bill, called the "Ban Asbestos in America Act of 2007" (S.742), was introduced by Senator Patty
Murray on March 1, 2007.

Asbestos may cause a variety of diseases, from non-cancerous forms such as asbestosis, to much more serious diseases such as mesothelioma. Workers exposed to asbestos in the 1940s, 50s, 60s, and 70s, are coming down with these diseases decades later due to the long latency period associated with all asbestos disease.

However, the noncommercial amphibole fibers (tremolite, anthophyllite and actinolite) may be present as contaminants in commercial products that use chrysotile asbestos, vermiculite and talc. The serpentine group, the other mineralogical group of asbestos, includes the chrysotile variety of
asbestos. Despite its hazardous properties, chrysotile was very popular with industry. It accounts for over 90% of the commercial asbestos used in the United States. Source: PATHOLOGY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED DISEASES (Victor L.
Roggli et al. eds., 2004).   Asbestos: A Historical Overview The term asbestos comes from a Greek word meaning unquenchable or indestructible.
The term asbestos refers to a group of mineral fibers that share properties of heat and chemical resistance, flexibility
and
high tensile strength. Because of these properties, asbestos was at one time popularly known as the magic mineral ; it has
been used in over 3,000 different
household or commercial products. IOM also addresses issues around the relative hazard of materials found in the workplace and the environment. Our focus is primarily on desk studies of the properties of materials that determine potential health effects in the lung. We have strong links with universities and other research organisations, in particular with Napier and Edinburgh Universities through the Edinburgh Lung and the Environment Research Initiative (ELEGI) and the Safety of Nanomaterials
Interdiscipinary Research Centre (SnIRC – ), and through our collaborations we can offer a wide range of specialised
expertise and facilities. Various studies
have been conducted over the
years concerning the
inhalation of asbestos dust and its relationship to asbestosis, increased rates of cancer and mesothelioma. The Union Asbestos and Rubber Company (UNARCO), an asbestos factory in Paterson, New Jersey, was in operation from 1941 through 1954 manufacturing asbestos insulation products for pipes, boilers, turbines and other industrial uses. 3 Dr. Irving J. Selikoff, Professor Emeritus of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine Following an initial evaluation of 17 workers who had filed compensation claims in 1951 against this employer, Dr.
Irving J. Selikoff, Professor Emeritus of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, and a world-renowned expert on
asbestos-related diseases, conducted a survey of the 933 men employed in the Paterson, New Jersey asbestos factory from 1941 to 1945. Dr. Selikoff reported that the factory workers suffered from asbestos-related disease in much greater proportion than that which could be expected in the general population. Asbestos in
homes that has not been disturbed is not thought to be actively dangerous. The danger is when the asbestos is moved or when it deteriorates — these circumstances may cause the release of asbestos fibers into the air, where they can be inhaled by people and living in a house. Years (even decades) spent living with asbestos exposure in one's home can result in serious and even life-threatening diseases caused by the
asbestos. It's imperative that homeowners and renters understand the risks they face from asbestos in the home environment. 48408)"*** even though the regulations address only material that is presently friable, it does not limit itself to material that is friable at the time of notification.

surprising when one considers that by one estimate, 1.2 billion square feet of asbestos-containing insulation can be found in 190,000 buildings in the U.S. alone. It has also
been estimated that the number of workers exposed through asbestos brake and clutch work is approximately 900,000. Workers may be exposed to asbestos in a wide variety of and , ranging from mining and milling to manufacturing and consumer industries. According to one estimate from the Asbestos Information Association, there are over 3,000 uses of asbestos. These uses have resulted in exposures through mining and
milling, in the manufacturing of asbestos-containing products, in shipbuilding and repair, and in construction. job sites trades Hazardous exposures to asbestos have also resulted from off-site releases from the mining,
milling and manufacturing industries potentially exposing residents in nearby communities. Mesothelioma - Cancer of the Lung Lining Asbestos Causes Mesothelioma Asbestos is the major cause of in the United States. Asbestos is a mineral that occurs as a long thin fiber in the environment. Until the
1980's, when asbestos was
banned due to its
health dangers, asbestos had been
used in many industrial and insulation materials as a fire retardant. Some of the jobs in which people have been exposed to asbestos directly or indirectly are those that
involve factory work, demolition, insulation, shipbuilding, carpentry, installation of brake linings in vehicles, and many other jobs. Review our section for a more detailed list of jobs. Despite efforts to eliminate
asbestos from our environment, many public and private buildings still contain asbestos today. Personnel who remove asbestos from such structures or work around asbestos are required to wear personal safety and breathing equipment to lower their risk of exposure to asbestos. The most common patterns, however, are the comb and pit decorations typical of North-Eastern Europe at the time (Finland).Asbestos pottery crucibles moulds slag bronze copper Neolithic Bronze Age J mon culture Japan The refers to vessels containing 90% asbestos and
10% clay, and can resist heat
up to 900 -1000 . The clay made the
shaping of vessel
possible, but the high amount of asbestos does not classify it as pottery in formal sense. It is believed that the asbestos ware was used in iron production such as , and . The vessel is also drilled with many holes. The fact that the of (FeO3) with abundant generates large amount of (CO) may suggest that the drilled
holes were used to
increase the influx of air () required
for proper glowing process. Iron ore is abundant in lakes e.g. Alimta (pemetrexed) in combination with Cisplatin (Platinol®) was recently approved by
the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of inoperable malignant mesothelioma. Your treating physician will let you know if you are a candidate for this type of chemotherapy regimen.
IMMUNOTHERAPY This type therapy
requires the removal of
a mesothelioma patient’s affected cells, activation of those cells and reintroduction into the infected peritoneum. This procedure is often done in conjunction with other forms of chemotherapy. It is generally thought that
a patient in the very early stages of
mesothelioma, would benefit the most from this
procedure. In fact, initial studies have shown that in some cases the procedure has been successful in “shrinking” the mesothelioma tumor.
