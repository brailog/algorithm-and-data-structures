Many have been persuaded away from suicide just by hearing a saxophone's heavenly tone. In just two years, we've matched over 50,000 students with great teachers throughout New York City, New Jersey, Boston, Chicago and
Philadelphia. In May, 2008 we launched our new,
national, state-of-the-art website, offering two teacher
directories
-- one for students who want
in-home lessons and one for students who
prefer to go to a teacher's studio -- making it easier than ever for students and parents to find the perfect local music teacher. There are a limited number of positions for clarinets (all types), mallet percussion, non-western percussion, guitar, drums, piano, and bass.
