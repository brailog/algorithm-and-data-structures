That said, articles and subject areas sometimes suffer from
significant
omissions,
and while misinformation and vandalism are usually corrected quickly, this does not always happen. (See for example in which a person inserted a fake biography linking a prominent
journalist to the Kennedy assassinations and Soviet Russia as a joke on a co-worker which went undetected for four months, saying afterwards he "didnt know was used as a serious reference
tool.") Therefore, a common conclusion is that it is a valuable resource and provides a good reference point on its subjects.

confused, catch-as-catch-can nature of the tactical situation at Midway resulted in the
torpedo bombers making unsupported attacks upon alerted and
heavily defended targets. The Devastator crews pressed on despite these overwhelming odds and the result was as tragic as it was inevitable. Their sacrifice, however, was not unrewarded. The low level attacks by the TBDs served to pull the Japanese fighter cover down “on the deck” allowing the high-flying SBDs to reach the target area and begin their dives unopposed. The resulting accuracy of
the American dive bombing attacks was largely responsible for the
victory at Midway. Unquestionably obsolete by the time
it saw combat, the Devastator nonetheless played a crucial role in the
opening months of the Pacific war. Bon Homme Richard was renamed Yorktown on 26 Sep 42 to commemorate USS Yorktown

Essex (CV-9), and Independence (CV-22) commanded by Rear Admiral C.A. Pownall for raids against Marcus Island in which considerable damage was done to enemy installations.Sigsbee returned to Pearl Harbor on 8 September 1943.   Sigsbee was off Wake Island three weeks later and participated in the bombardment of that island on 5 October.  On 21 October, the destroyer stood out of Pearl Harbor en route to Efate, New Hebrides.She arrived on 5 November and spent the next two
weeks in training with transports.On 13 November, Sigsbee sortied with Task Unit (TU) 53.1.4 for the Gilbert Islands.On 22 and 23 November, she bombarded Betio, Tarawa Atoll.She then returned to Pearl Harbor on 14 December for a yard availability period.     On 22 January 1944, Sigsbee sailed out of Pearl Harbor with Task Force (TF) 52 to participate in the assault and capture of Kwajalein,

Captain of the Maine at the time of her loss.He was then Captain of the USS St. Paul from 5 May 1998 until the end of the Spanish American War.   Sigsbee (DD-502) was laid down on 22
July 1942 by Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., Kearny, N.J.; launched on 7 December 1942, sponsored by Mrs. The port engine was knocked out of commission, the starboard engine
could
only be run at five knots, steering was lost, and much
of the main deck was awash.    Sigsbee was towed back to
Guam by the ocean going tug Munsee, where she was
sufficiently repaired to enable her to make the voyage to Pearl Harbor.The destroyer
arrived there on 17 June and had a complete new 60-foot stern installed. The new system, called SYTEX, is being fitted on the Charles de Gaulle as well as other vessels and shore locations and will allow the vessel to access national or coalition command networks. Surface-to-air missiles The SAAM (surface anti-air missile) system, developed by Eurosam (set up by MBDA and Thales), provides defence against hostile aircraft and anti-ship missiles. The system uses the Aster 15
surface-to-air missile and entered operational service in November 2002, with the first firing of the missile from the Charles
de Gaulle. The Aster missile has a 13kg warhead and a range of 30km. The missile's guidance is inertial with data uplink and active radar terminal homing. For increased manoeuvrability in the
terminal phase, the missile uses a 'PIF-PAF' direct thrust control system with gas jets. Two eight-cell Sylver vertical launch systems are installed on the starboard side forward of the
bridge and two on the port
side aft of the bridge. The system uses the Thales (formerlyThomson-CSF) Arabel radar, which is a multi-function three-dimensional radar with a range of 70km for a target area of 2m². The ship has two six-cell Sadral launching systems for the MBDA (formerly Matra BAe Dynamics) Mistral anti-aircraft and anti-missile missile. Mistral has an infra-red seeker and a range
of 4km.
20F2 20mm
guns The ship is equipped with eight
Nexter (formerly Giat) 20F2 20mm guns, which fire 0.25kg
shells at 720 rounds/min to a range of up to 8km. The horrific losses suffered by the American torpedo bombers at Midway were not so much due to any inadequacy of the design as to the limitations imposed on the aircraft by the weapon they carried combined with a disastrous tactical situation. The
Bliss-Leavitt
Mark XIII aerial torpedo was apt to break apart if dropped from an altitude greater than 100 feet and a speed higher than 110 knots. An aircraft thus engaged in a torpedo attack against a warship was extremely vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire and defending fighters. The key to successful deployment of the torpedo depended upon either complete surprise or assault by several
aircraft from multiple directions,
covered by friendly fighters and carefully choreographed with simultaneous dive-bomber and horizontal bomber attacks to divide the enemy's defensive fire.
Chung-Hoon USN, relieved Commander Russell as commanding officer.After patrolling in the Guadalcanal area for several weeks,
Sigsbee joined TU 53.1.14 to take part in the Mariana
Islands campaign.The destroyer bombarded the Guam
beaches during the period 16 to 18 July as well as covering the underwater demolition teams on the beaches.She then joined the picket screen and remained off Guam until 3 August.

confronting the Coast Guard.  On the morning of 17 May 1980 the pleasure craft , carrying 52 persons, sank when the people on board panicked because of rough seas, ran to the stern, and caused

Washington. The Saratoga Air Group
consisted of:   Bombing Squadron Three (VB-3) with 21 Douglas SBD-3 Dauntless   Fighting Squadron Three (VF-3) with 7 Grumman F4F-3 and 2 F4F-3A Wildcats   Scouting Squadron Three (VS-3) with 22 Douglas

USS YORKTOWN
(CV-5) USS Yorktown was at
Norfolk,
Virginia on 7 Dec 41. von Paulsen borrowed a Vought UO-1 seaplane from the Navy. Operating from Squantum, MA and later Ten Pound Island in Gloucester Harbor, he demonstrated the
potential of aviation in combating the
smuggling of whiskey. Prohibition had become the law of the land in 1920 and soon its enforcement became the dominant mission
of the
Coast Guard. As a result, Congress
appropriated
$152,000 for five aircraft, the first to be owned by the service. Three Loening OL-5 amphibians and two Chance Vought UO4s were
purchased.
These
aircraft
were
flown from air stations at Gloucester, Massachusetts and
Cape May, New Jersey, until 1931 when they were replaced. Thus, Coast Guard
aviation owed its first aircraft to the mission of law
enforcement.  The air station at Cape May was the first permanent Coast Guard air station and was first commissioned in 1926.  Full specifications The 38,000t, nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles De Gaulle was constructed at the DCN Brest naval shipyard in Brittany. The ship was launched in May 1994 and commissioned in September 2000, following sea trials which began
in January 1999. As a result of trials
the landing deck has been lengthened by 4.4m to enable the E-2C to land and clear the
deck quickly. "Charles De Gaulle is a 38,000t,
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, constructed at Brest in Brittany." In 1955 Coast Guard helicopters rescued more than 300
people as rivers overflowed in Connecticut and Massachusetts.  In December of that year the Coast Guard on-scene commander directed the
rescue of thousands in California.  Included among the 21 rescue aircraft were Coast Guard helicopters.   In one incident an H04S [left]
rescued 138 people during a 12-hour period; this was accomplished by two air crews.  The helicopter soon grew from a thoroughbred requiring pampering to keep it flying to a reliable workhorse. The responsibilities of Coast Guard fixed wing aviation also increased following World War
II.  In 1946, Coast Guard aircraft were used for the first time on the International Ice Patrol, a practice that continues today. The primary objective of these Ice Patrol flights is to
observe ice floating in the vicinity of the Grand Banks, so that shipping in that well-traveled area can be advised of current conditions throughout the iceberg season.  Ice Patrol flight tracks are normally between 1,000 and 1,500 nautical miles long (from six to eight hoursflight
time).  Since 1983 the flights have used HC130 aircraft
carrying
Side-Looking
Airborne Radar (SLAR) equipment as the primary reconnaissance tool.  At the
normal altitude of 8,000 feet, the SLAR can cover a swath extending 35 miles on each side of the aircraft. He also piloted one of two HS-1 seaplanes that bombed and machine-gunned a German U-boat off the coast of New England. The bombs failed to explode and the submarine escaped. A by-product of the war effort was the stimulus and potential to fly the Atlantic. In May 1919, four Navy Curtiss seaplanes, each crewed by five, began the great experiment. One plane, ultimately succeeded. It was captained by LCDR A.C. Read, USN and was piloted by LT Elmer

article itself. On 7 December 1941,
the U.S. Navy had seven aircraft carriers (CVs) and one aircraft escort vessel (AVG) in commission. The CVs were considered warships and  the AVG was
considered an auxiliary vessel. In addition to these eight ships, the keels of five other CVs had been laid.  As has been related endlessly, by a fantastic coincidence none of the carriers was at Pearl Harbor, and escaped the Japanese attack. While they sank or crippled much of America's battleship fleet, the Japanese achieved little, because it was the fleet carriers and
not the battleships that were to win the Pacific war for America. Still,
even had the Japanese sunk 2-3 carriers, at best they
might
have
gained a year for themselves. America could not have taken the counter-offensive in 1942, but by 1943 it would have struck west
when the new carriers started coming on line. The economic
disparity between Japan and America was too great to be remedied by the potential sinking of a handful of carriers.   USS

Aircraft The ship can operate
a fleet of up to 40 aircraft: Rafale M (range 3,340km), Super
Etendard (range 1,682km) and three E-2C Hawkeye airborne early warning aircraft. The ship will also support the AS 565 Panther or NH 90
helicopter. The main deck consists of a main runway angled at
8.5° to the ship's axis and an aircraft launch area forward of the island. These are each equipped with a USN Type C13 catapult, capable of
launching one aircraft a minute. The runway is 195m
long and the whole deck measures 260m x 64m. The carrier is fitted with
the Sagem
Defense S curit (formerly EADS Defence & Electronics) DALAS laser landing aid. SATRAP
computerised stabilisation system The carrier is fitted with the SATRAP computerised, integrated stabilisation system designed to maintain stabilisation to within 0.5° of
horizontal, allowing aircraft to be operated up to sea state 5/6.
"Charles De Gaulle can operate a fleet of up to 40 aircraft." As
well as the carrier's two pairs of active stabilising fins and twin
rudders, the system has two
computer-controlled compensation units which consist of two rail tracks for trains carrying 22t of deadweight. The aircraft carrier will also be fitted with a SLAT anti-torpedo system being developed by Euroslat, a consortium consisting of WASS (Whitehead Alenia Sistemi Subacquei), DCNS
and Thales Underwater
Systems
(formerly Thomson Marconi Sonar). Radar sensor suite The suite of radar sensors installed on the carrier are: Thales DRBJ 11B three dimensional long range air search radar operating in the E- to F- bands; Thales DRBV 26D Jupiter medium / long-range air search radar operating at D-band;
Thales DRBV 15C Sea Tiger mk2 air and surface search radar operating at E and F bands; two Thales (formerly Racal) Model 1229 navigation radars operating at I band; and the Thales Arabel fire control radar operating at I to J band. This system is designed to compensate for wind and heel and
control roll, yaw and surge. Combat management systems The ship's weapons are managed by a Senit combat management system, which has the capacity to track up to 2,000 targets. The weapon control system consists of two Vigy 105 optronic directors supplied by Sagem. The ship also has two Sagem Vampir search and track systems.

Under construction as Bon Homme Richard, this new Essex-class carrier was renames Yorktown in honor of Yorktown
(CV-5), sunk at the epic Battle of Midway (June 1942). Built in an amazing 16 months at Newport News, Virginia, Yorktown was commissioned on April 15, 1943. Yorktown participated significantly in the Pacific Offensive that began in late 1943 and ended with the defeat of Japan in 1945.
Yorktown received the Presidential Unit Citation and earned 11 battle stars for service in World War II. Much of the Academy Award-winning (1944) documentary "The Fighting Lady" was filmed aboard Yorktown. In the 1950, Yorktown was modified with the addition of and angled deck to better operate jet aircraft in her role as an attack carrier (CVA). In 1958, Yorktown was
designated an anti-submarine aircraft carrier (CVS), and
would later earn 5 battle stars for
service
off Vietnam (1965-1968).

has gotten more of a raw deal from history than the Douglas TBD-1 “Devastator.” When it joined the fleet in 1936, the TBD-1 heralded a new era in naval aviation. Its sleek monoplane design, all metal construction, 200 mph-plus speed, powered folding wings, and retractable landing gear
stood in stark contrast to contemporaries like the British Fairey
Swordfish. Strange as it may seem, the Devastator was the first American carrier-based aircraft to be equipped with wheel brakes.   The
British Fleet
Air Arm placed an order for the new Fairey Swordfish in 1936, the same year the Douglas TBD-1 made its maiden flight. Photo

Arm Museum.   Today the Devastator is most often remembered as the woefully
obsolete
torpedo
bomber whose crews were slaughtered at the Battle of Midway. Of
the forty-one TBDs launched that day from USS , , and , only four returned – a 90% loss rate. All of the fifteen airplanes in
squadron (VT-8) were shot down. Not a single torpedo found its mark.HornetEnterpriseYorktownHornet’s What is usually forgotten is that the TBD’s newer, faster, more heavily-armed replacement, the Grumman TBF-1 “Avenger” fared no better that day. By the late 1920s the search and rescue clientele had changed primarily from coastal sailors to oceangoing motor ships. Ships moved their trade routes farther out to sea away from the dangers of the shoreline as the use of steam and diesel engines for propulsion and steel for construction increased. Now when
emergencies arose, they were frequently far off the coast. In 1928
an aviation section was established
at Coast
Guard Headquarters under the command of Commander Norman
Hall.  It drew up specifications for a multi-mission aircraft which, given the technology of the day, could be met only by a large seaplane or amphibian. To aid distressed mariners, the Coast Guard developed the concept of the "flying lifeboats." These aircraft could fly hundreds of
miles, land in an open and frequently uninviting sea, and carry out a rescue. Seven aircraft were acquired, two Douglas Dolphin RD-2s, which were modified to Coast Guard requirements, and five General Aviation Flying Life Boat PJ-1s which were specifically designed for the service. All were named for important stars. These aircraft were involved in numerous rescues. The primary impetus for this was the increasing number of offshore crashes, mostly by student pilots.  These
were the result of the rapid expansion of
military aviation during the war. Initially, the amphibious PBY-5A and high speed rescue craft were chosen as the rescue vehicles and additional squadrons were formed.  In December 1944 the Office of Air Sea Rescue was established at Coast Guard Headquarters.  By 1945 Air Sea Rescue was responsible for 165 aircraft and nine air stations.  During that year, it had
responded to 686 plane crashes.  The PBY-5As were replaced by Martin PBM-5Gs following the war.left The post-World War II years brought an explosion in the number of recreational boats and created a new search and rescue clientele. The helicopter was ideally suited to this mission.  Able to react swiftly, it could lift entire pleasure boat crews from imminent disaster, or
in less trying circumstances,
deliver de-watering pumps and fuel. Admittedly, during its early years the helicopter had a major handicap--the pilot needed three hands in order to fly it.  Soon, helicopters rescuing distressed
boaters became a commonplace event. Cone, First World War

of the
Treasury.  He was an aviation
enthusiast and supported its expansion within the Coast
Guard. 
He transferred the aviation detachment of the Customs Service to the
Coast Guard in 1934.  In fact, the materiel benefits of this
transfer were small because they introduced into the Coast Guard a conglomeration of aircraft that were mostly poor in condition and impossible to maintain. Notwithstanding, the Secretary
enthusiasm for Coast Guard aviation was important to its
development.
He
obtained
Public
Works Administration (PWA) funds for the purchase of new
aircraft and additional air stations. 
By 1936 the Coast Guard had six air stations, two air detachments
and 42
aircraft. Also during the 1930s, the marriage between the cutter and aircraft took place.  The 327-foot cutters embarked either a Grumman JF-2 or Curtiss SOC-4 [left, with USCGC Bibb] amphibians.   Bombing Squadron Five (VB-5) with 19 Douglas SBD-3 Dauntless   Fighting Squadron Forty Two (VF-42) with 18 Grumman F4F-3 Wildcats   Scouting Squadron Five (VS-5) with 19 Douglas SBD-3 Dauntless and 2 North American SNJ-3s   Torpedo Squadron Five (VT-5) with 14 Douglas TBD-1 Devastators USS Yorktown was sunk by aerial bombs and torpedoes during the Battle of Midway, 7 Jun 42.  Her name was struck from the Naval Register on 2 Oct 42.

idea and
were taken on experimental flights in the school aircraft. A Curtiss F flying
boat was used for much of the
experiment.   The aircraft lacked navigational equipment and, therefore, never ventured
beyond the sight of land. In spite of the technological limitations of the aircraft,
the experiment proved successful and as a result Stone and five others were assigned to the Naval Aviation School at
Pensacola for training in April 1916. Hall was sent to the Curtiss factory to study aeronautical engineering. Later in 1916, Congress authorized the Coast
Guard to establish ten air stations, but no money was appropriated and this effort was stillborn. During World War I, Coast Guard aviators were assigned to naval air stations in this country and abroad. His other awards include the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal and World War II Victory Medal.. USS (DE-39) was the first ship to be named in his honor. Althought DE-272 was
to be named Lovering, her name was changed prior to her transfer to the Royal Navy. (HammannHammannI-168YorktownYorktownHammannYorktownHammann Lovering Photo from the archives at Harvard University. Bill Gonyo 25 November 1943 - Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton WA John Klar 25

began leasing MH-68 Mako helicopters to outfit a new squadron,
HITRON-10,
formed to augment the service's capabilities in the continuing fight
against
narcotics
smuggling.  The squadron was developed specifically to combat the drug-smugglers' use of what are called "go-fast" boats.  These MH-68s carry an armed Coast Guardsman who, if needed, could use
his .50 caliber sniper rifle to disable a
"go-fast" boat that refused a demand to stop and be boarded.  This is not the first time Coast Guard aircraft were armed during peacetime; Loening OL-5s carried .30 caliber Lewis guns during the service's earlier fight to enforce Prohibition. To assist those in distress and to patrol
national waters, the Coast Guard flies some 200 aircraft from 27
air stations, large and small, throughout the continental United States, Hawaii, Alaska
and Puerto Rico.  The Coast Guard is the seventh largest naval air force in the world.  Coast Guard aviation, rotary and fixed wing, moves into the future proud of its past and

It returned to its home port of Toulon in July 2002. Super Etendard and Hawkeye E-2C aircraft carried out a number of sorties but the ship's F1 standard Rafale M fighters did not take part in operations, although they were included in exercises with the US Navy. In April 2007, DCN became DCNS. This followed an agreement in which Thales became a 25% shareholder
in the new company and DCN acquired the naval business of Thales France (excluding naval equipment). Article Continues In September 2007, Charles de Gaulle began a refit which includes overhaul and refuelling of the nuclear propulsion system and installing a new SYTEX command and control system with
Syracuse III satellite communications
system. The combat system will also be adapted for operations with
the Rafale F3 equipped with AASM, ASMPA
and Scalp-EG missiles It is expected to return to service in early 2009.
The French Navy plans to build a
second carrier to enter service around 2015, when the Charles de Gaulle is scheduled for refuelling and refit. These plans have been put on hold and a decision
is
not planned until 2011. The
new carrier would not be the same class as the Charles de Gaulle, but would be a conventionally powered carrier.
