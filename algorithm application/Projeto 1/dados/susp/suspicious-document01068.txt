The confused, catch-as-catch-can nature of the tactical situation at Midway resulted in the torpedo bombers making unsupported
attacks upon alerted and heavily defended targets. The Devastator crews pressed on despite these overwhelming odds and the result was as tragic as it was inevitable. Their sacrifice, however, was not unrewarded. The low level attacks by the TBDs served to pull the Japanese fighter cover down “on the deck” allowing the high-flying SBDs to reach the target area and begin their dives unopposed. The resulting accuracy of the American dive bombing attacks was largely responsible for the victory at Midway. Unquestionably obsolete by the time it saw
combat, the Devastator nonetheless played a crucial role in the opening months of the Pacific war. Others will later be augmented with new sections. Some information will be considered by later
