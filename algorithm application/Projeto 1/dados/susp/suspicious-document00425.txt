We went to Brazil on a birding trip, but we arrived two days early to
visit a former student of mine,

University in Rio de Janeiro. We celebrated my 80th birthday with them. Then we
birded in the mountains near Rio (Itatiaia), then
Iguacu Falls, both the Argentina side and the Brazil side, and then the Pantanal, which is a large wet land in the West. First, at neighborhood assemblies, residents identify local priority needs, generate ideas to respond to these needs, and elect delegates to represent each community. These delegates then discuss the local priorities and develop
concrete projects that address
them, together with experts. Next,
residents vote for
which of these projects to fund. Finally,
the government implements the chosen projects, and residents monitor this implementation. For example, if neighborhood residents identify access to medical care as a priority, their delegates might develop a proposal for a new community health clinic. If
the residents approve the proposal, the
city funds it. The next year, a new health clinic is built. Roughly 1,200 cities have participatory budgets already. Several countries have passed laws making participatory budgeting mandatory for local
governments. The UN and other international organizations have actively promoted it. You may also view each

seen at the balls and parades include
bones, feathers, and grass, reminiscent of African traditions. The presence of
feathers symbolizes the strength to prevail over adversity and
resistance while becoming
a strong, divine person. Listening to the
musical beats of the Carnival music presents another layer of the African influence as well as the presence of an indispensable element of the celebration. Numerous obstacles, including mountainous terrain and dense Amazon forests, have hindered construction of a nationwide transportation network. Most of the railway trackage is in the southeast and serves the densely settled areas of S o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minais Gerais states. Trackage is also substantial in the northeast. Most of the railways are owned and operated by the federal government. Highways and motor vehicles provide the chief means of overland freight and passenger transportation. Major intercity roads are paved; most other roads are dirt and sometimes hazardous to travel. Bras lia, with roads to virtually every region, is the hub of the expanding highway network. New highways across the Amazon Basin, including the Trans-Amazon Highway from Recife to the Peruvian border, have been gigantic construction projects of the federal government. Brazil's rivers provide the longest inland waterway system in the world. Falklands/Malvinas Furthermore, the military establishments of the nations involved have a vested interest in using these possible conflicts as justifications for their budgets, troop levels, and influence. Their use of classical "war hypotheses" based on geopolitical thinking and historic animosities with neighbors is an enduring feature which has shaped military roles and missions. Thus, CBMs can have considerable potential if they serve to reduce these animosities, diminish the credibility of the "war hypotheses", and make the possibilities of conflict less likely.

Over 75 percent of the people in
crisis-riddled Zimbabwe are living in desperate poverty, with children bearing the brunt. And with rival parties still wrangling over implementation of a power-sharing agreement signed four months ago, things are likely to get worse before they improve. A report released by Save the Children (SCF) found that 10 out of the 13
million people still in Zimbabwe live in abject poverty, struggling to access food and other essentials. A local alliance of non-governmental organisations said the figures could be higher than that.

Tancredo Neves had said that his election and the demise of military r gime would create a "New Republic" and Sarney's term of government is often referred to by this name.

disastrous in almost every field. The ongoing and the soaring drained the country's assets

attempt to
revolutionize the economy and defeat
inflation, Sarney carried on an ambitious "heterodox" economic plan () in 1986, which included price controls, default on the external debts and reduction of salaries. The plan seemed successful for some months, but it soon caused wholesale shortages of consumer goods (especially of easily exportable goods like meat, milk,
automobiles, grains, sugar and
alcohol) and the appearance of a black market in which
such goods were sold for higher prices. Some buildings and

of Mona Vie? (It's a nutritional beverage company that
is open in the US, Canada, Puerto Rico, Japan,

Distributors are able to JOIN FOR FREE during this

at: Don't let this awesome opportunity pass you
by!!! But models sophisticated enough to be useful in preparing for those changes have not surfaced in Brazil  until now. Jos Marengo, a researcher at the Center for Weather Forecast and Climate Studies has been evaluating climate change scenarios for Brazil using the country's first-ever regional models, which allow more detail than the global versions. Climate models show the surface of the Earth under a three-dimensional grid. In a global model, each grid cell covers hundreds of kilometres. But climate in specific regions is affected by atmospheric circulations and topographical features  such as mountains or valleys  on scales smaller than the 300 kilometre grid cells of global models. Grid cells in regional models, however, cover just 40 kilometres each and so can provide specific information on, for instance, how a sea breeze can change or how often it rains in a city. Good maps of Salvador are available at the Bahiatursa Tourist Office in Pelourinho. Many tours of the city are offered as well, of the historic Pelourinho, important museums, the history of Capoeira and practices, and many more! These will help you penetrate the Salvador and the Bahian culture much more deeply. And last, though definitely not least, there is the magnificent Carnaval in Salvador. This celebration has become quite the sensation, as well as a competitor to the original in Rio. The essential difference between the two is in Salvador, everyone participates. According to their plan the would be expanded beyond the current fifteen members to include twenty-five members. This would be the first time that permanent status has been extended to a nation and supporters of the G4 plan suggest that this will lead to greater representation of developing nations rather than the current major participants. Chasteen has always sought to understand and interpret, above all, the of the past. This historical enterprise has so far included studies of everything from armed insurgency to social dance, and it has lingered in many different parts of Latin America, especially Brazil, the R o de la Plata, and more recently, the Andes. In his research, Chasteen always asks "what it was like to be there," and in his writing he uses
various narrative
strategies to communicate the
answer. Language and literature figure importantly in his life and in his work, as does a commitment to Latin American studies beyond a single country of interest. As a graduate teacher, he likes topics off the beaten path
(which is where he finds his own), he is more the coach than the authority, and he pays special attention to writing technique. The far south of Brazil has a more temperate climate than the rest of the country. It is marked by a greater range of temperatures during the year and fairly evenly distributed precipitation. Frosts occur
as far north as S o Paulo state; occasional light snow falls at the higher elevations. Vegetation is as varied as the climates of Brazil. Most of the Amazon Basin and the coastal areas between Salvador and Santos are covered
by lush tropical rain forests, or selvas.
