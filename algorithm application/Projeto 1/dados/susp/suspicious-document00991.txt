In 1899, Deam attended the annual meeting of Indiana Academy of Science and here began to acquire his reputation as a noteworthy botanist.On visits to Mexico in 1900 and Guatemala in 1904, he found new plant specimens which cemented his reputation.However, by 1905 he realized that worldwide botany was too much for one man to master and that, in order to really achieve, all botanists need a small segment of the science in which to specialize and a limited geographic territory in which to work.Thus, Deam decided to focus on Indiana botany.In the spring of 1906 he had 665 specimens in hand; by the end of 1906 this increased to 1,785, and by 1908 it was 5,377.The growth of the collection was extraordinary, especially given the difficulty of travel in those years.       Casino jobs Looking for employment in the casino industry?
