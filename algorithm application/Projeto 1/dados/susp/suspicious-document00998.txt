All of this went hand in hand with an increased awareness of quality in the work conducted in the vineyards, plus the growing interest in wine by consumers. With new grape varieties arousing curiosity, traditional varieties being resurrected, and red wines gaining renown in a country long dominated by its white wines, it became very clear: the ‘Austrian wine miracle’ had begun. Not only did the world take notice of Austrian wine, but numerous awards confirmed the top quality paired with the individuality of the wines produced by Austrian wine-growers. As Austrian wine began its meteoric rise in the international wine scene, the Austrian Wine Marketing Board was created in 1986, and in 1991, the Austrian Wine Academy became an internationally recognised educational body. Also, upon joining the European Union in 1995, Austria adopted EU wine laws. Our frame of reference for love is usually based in the emotional realm through an experience with another.For instance, our idea of love might be from the memory we have of a girlfriend our first- or our parents or siblings.  Yet we use the word to describe affection for innate things like "ice-cream and "football and "beer.

But has anyone thought it possible
the water that Jesus turned to wine was not fermented wine? In light of Proverbs 23:34, I believe Jesus turned the water into the pure juice of the vine (not fermented). If that were the case, then Jesus himself would have been a stumbling block and a hypocrite. Paul said it was okay to “take a
little wine for thy stomach’s sake” (medicinal purposes). I believe that would be the only occasion to take of alcohol during biblical times. Now days we have so much “medicine” for various illnesses that does not contain alcohol that there is no excuse to consume alcohol in any form. Can you prove
