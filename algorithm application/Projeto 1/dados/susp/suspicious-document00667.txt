George Washington took office in New York City on April 30, 1789. Washington acted carefully and deliberately, aware of the need to build an executive structure that could accommodate future presidents. Because he supported many of Hamiltons controversial fiscal policies, he became a target of attacks for many Jeffersonian
Democratic-Republicans. Although many people encouraged Washington to go for his third term, he refused because he was weary of politics. Earnestly desiring leisure, feeling a decline of his physical powers, and wincing under opposites abuse, Washington refused to yield to the general pressure for a third term. He retired in March

Julius Caesar Shakespeare Caesar , in his book , refers to the chest of man as the seat of magnanimity, or sentiment, with this magnanimity working as the liaison between visceral and cerebral man. Lewis asserts that in his
time, the denial of the emotions that are found in the eternal, the sublime, that which is humbling as an objective reality, had led to "men without chests." Francis Hutcheson A System of Moral Philosophy Reformation [10] In the German Enlightenment, gave a highly developed treatment of this inalienability argument. Like Hutcheson, Hegel based
the theory of inalienable rights on the inalienability of those aspects of personhood that distinguish persons from things. A thing, like a piece of property, can in fact be transferred from one person to another. But the same would not apply to those aspects that make one a person, wrote Hegel: Hegel de facto The right to what is
in essence inalienable is imprescriptible, since the act whereby I take possession of my personality, of my substantive essence, and make myself a responsible being, capable of possessing rights and with a moral and religious life, takes away from these
characteristics of mine just that externality which alone made them capable of passing into the possession of someone else. Joseph Smith cannot be dismissed as a colorful fraud,
Bushman argues, nor seen only as a restorer of religious truth. Entangled in nineteenth-century Yankee cultureincluding the skeptical EnlightenmentSmith was nevertheless an original who cut his own path. And while there are
multiple contexts from which to draw an understanding of Joseph Smith (including magic, seekers, the Second Great Awakening, communitarianism, restorationism, and more), Bushman suggests that Smith stood at the cusp of modernity and presented the possibility of belief in a time of growing skepticism. When examined
carefully, the is found
to have intricate subplots and peculiar cultural twists. Bushman discusses the books ambivalence toward republican government, explores the culture of the Lamanites (the enemies of the favored people), and traces the books fascination with records, translation, and history.
