like these … dumbass Arjun Singh Aug 6th, 2006 at 8:40 pm hey man,…. what u guys think….first of all who are you to tell whether you need arjun singh or not, with just 10% of population…. if you talk then talk sensibly. have u ever thought before speaking. your comments are contradictory themselves. Either say that creamy layer is taking seats or say 45% of IIT reserved seats go unfilled. arent these two statements by u
contradictory. who says reservation doesnt help. in 1960s nobody got into medical college in states or 2-3 when seats were 20……now 20 times get
qualified and they
fight..isnt that the effect of reservation. Why not caste system in reservation, when u guys kepts us starved for so long. u r very mean when the RDA president of
AIIMS is himself an OBC and his wife is holding an OBC reserved position. why dont u ask his wife to resign.
where u go when AIIMS graduate gets PG
seat at 15% and ST gets at 50%. where
you go when AIIMS still has
its own reservation. is that merit. where u go when rich people get into private colleges easily. who is rich. majority of general category. even if OBC reservation gets into phases, who is at loss? we or u?.. just remember one thing. u were having ur maximum power and maximum number. see wats happening…..now it ll
only get worse for
you. reservation ll exist forever and u
cant do anything.     (Click on the Info

ERHSsuggestion@sowashco.k12.mn.us
(please scan the entry and attach
as image file or PDF to the e‐mail) FAX: (651) 458‐6318 A committee of students, staff, and administration will choose the winning submission. The
creator of the winning lyrics will be
identified on the sheet music, and will receive an ERHS “pirit Pack”including a sweatshirt, hat, and other items. Some guidelines for your submission: 1) All lyrics must be
submitted with words
legibly written underneath the printed music of the song (this guarantees that your lyrics match the existing melody). This was the second year in a row when the band successfully won the Ancient City PResentation of Band competition. Their score was the highest ever received by the band and with this score, the ERHS band also blocked at State Compettion. This was a very big accomplishment for the band, and they are all very proud. 2) Specific values, discussed by students, incorporate what the
community
of East Ridge stands for. These
values are: pride, aggressiveness, leadership, respect, brotherhood/sisterhood, strength,
enthusiasm, determination, tradition, unity, trust, domination, power, fearlessness, focus, intimidation, intelligence, and awareness. The lyrics should reflect
these values. 3) Your lyrics
should fit the existing music
without rhythmic adaptation.
You may add or remove slurs to fit your lyrics. 4) There should be a rhyme scheme evident in your lyrics. 5) Use elements of the ERHS identity, such as “Raptors,” “East Ridge,” “Black and Gold,” and “East Ridge High School.” 6) Try to make your lyrics applicable for many sports and activities (the original lyrics are specific to football). Judging Criteria: 1) Lyrics fit the rhythmic scheme of the existing melody 2) Lyrics use elements of the ERHS Identity (colors, mascot, title) 3) Lyrics avoid questionable text or double meanings 4)
Lyrics are applicable for various
sports and activities 5) Lyrics are memorable 6) Lyrics reflect the values of ERHS Name: ___________________________________________________ Address: _________________________________________________ City: ____________________________ ZIP: ___________________ E‐mail:

[] edit Sports The sports teams at East Ridge train in their practice fields or gym or at the National Training Center about a mile from campus. ERHS Band Program [] edit Concert Season In the 2006-2007 school year, East Ridge High School's Wind Ensemble went to State Competition receiving scores of good, excellent and good resulting in an overall good rating. This is the first time East Ridge has gone to State Competition for Concert Band. The band was
directed by Jack Hart and was composed of 51 students. The examination was two hours long, and exam booklets were provided. The professor was very strict and told the class that any exam that was not on his desk in exactly two hours would not be accepted and the student would fail. 1/2 hour into the exam, a student came rushing in and asked the professor for an exam booklet. "You're not going to have time to finish this," the professor stated sarcastically as he handed the student a booklet. "Yes I will," replied the student. He then
took a
seat and began
writing. After two hours, the professor called for the exams, and the students filed up and handed them in. All except the late student, who
continued writing. 1/2 hour later, the last student came up to the professor who was sitting at his desk
preparing for his next class.
He attempted to put his exam on the stack of exam booklets already there. "No you don't, I'm not going to accept that. It's late." The student looked
incredulous
and angry. "Do you know WHO I am?" "No, as a matter of fact I don't," replied the professor with an air of disdain.. "DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?" the
student asked again.. "No, and
I don't care," the imperious professor sneered. "Good," replied the student, who quickly lifted the stack of completed exams, stuffed his in the
middle, and walked out of the room. I too support scholorships based on economical status to everyone but not without merit. Though, the standard of our high scools are very poor, that is one reason why poor people are not able to compete with the students from private scoools (not always but true provided both students have same abilities). So, we should first improve the standards of our high scools and elementary
schools. Then we can remove the
reservations
from 10+2 onwards and limit the admission based on the merit alone.
