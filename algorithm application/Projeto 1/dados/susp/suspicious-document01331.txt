The United States Congress approved fishery disaster assistance funding in 2003, with nearly $7 million in federal assistance going to Florida's shrimp industry. In a consumer survey conducted by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, 82 percent of respondents who preferred domestic shrimp indicated they would be willing to pay $1 to $3 more per pound for the quality of domestic shrimp. But there has been a real difficulty even for instructors most anxious that their students should have the case for bare-land-value taxation fairly
presented to them. The complete from which these selections are made would take more time than most teachers might wish to devote to a single topic in economics, whatever its importance. The paragraphs here printed have been selected so as to present in brief compass the essentials of Henry George's argument in his own eloquent and inimitable style. Only such slight textual changes have been made as seemed necessary to preserve continuity. In almost any course in economics can be found space for the few assignments necessary to cover these selected paragraphs, and any class can be asked to meet the trifling
incident expense. Thus might be given a new zest and renewed
enthusiasm to the students
whose sometimes waning interest in the categories and
laws of economics is a recurrent discouragement to their instructors. Served on crushed ice with Bacardi & vanilla. $11 Viking Burial Heavy

ambulences and other emergency vehicles rallied to protect this cultural icon. Every smoke alarm had gone off, suggesting the worst to the alarm company, which alerted the fire companies. No one was injured, the fire was confined to the boiler room, and smoke and water damage were minimal.
Little if any smoke smell remains. The cause of the fire was two-fold, said Steve Cohen: a repair of the furnace was never finalized in spite of repeated calls to the heating contractor, and falling corrosion from the stone chimney had accumulated at the furnace, blocking the vent.

Hopkins As someone who has struggled
to find my calling, my specific purpose
in life, Hopkins reminds me
that as a "mortal thing", I can do "one thing and the same". Hopkins asserts that my purpose, what I do, flows out of who I am. Finding my calling in
life is intertwined with finding the real me. Contrary to how people define themselves by what they do, Hopkins believes that what
one does, flows from who they are. Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high Sayin' "For whose sake did you live, for whose sake did you die?" Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do For not breakin' down no bedroom door to get at you. Always was a sucker for the right cross. Never
wanted to go home 'til the last cent was lost. Maybe
someday you will look back and see That I made it so easy for you to follow me.  Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell. I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well. Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike. There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike. You said you were going' to Frisco, stay a couple of months.

The film was also popular in the United Kingdom, drawing 9 million to the theatres. Jewish audiences were deeply moved by the portrayal of Jewish characters and their plight, which was still a taboo subject in Hollywood films of the time. Critical opinion was mixed, with many reviewers critical of Chaplin's final speech, and some felt the portrayal of storm troopers was inappropriate. Las Vegas Broadway, as the name implies, is a large, wide avenue in New York City, New York, and is one of the oldest main north-south
thoroughfares in the city, dating back to the first Dutch New Amsterdam settlement. It runs the length of Manhattan, the central borough, being the only street running from almost the southern tip of the island, where it starts at Bowling Green, to the northern tip. It then crosses the Harlem River as the Bridge and continues through the Bronx and into Westchester County. Bring a pot of liberally salted water to a boil, add pasta and cook until almost al dente then strain, the pasta should be slightly undercooked. 2. Preheat oven to 375°F. Transfer pasta to a 3 to 4 quart baking dish. Add 2 cups of marinara
sauce, 4 ounces of mozzarella, and
1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (if using the optional ricotta cheese add it all at this point also), and toss until well combined. 3. Top with the
remaining sauce and sprinkle on the remaining
cheeses. Place the baking
dish in the oven and bake until the cheese on top is melted and slightly browned, 15-20 minutes. As Lazuli is about to be tortured, Ouf's astrologer, Siroco, rushes in to inform the King that one day after Lazuli dies, so too will the King, andccording to the clever King's will5 minutes later, Siroco himself must die. Ouf
cancels the execution and leads Lazuli
in full splendor to his palace. After two more acts of zany mixups, Laoula and Lazuli are happily united. Ouf names the youthful Lazuli his heir, happy in the knowledge that the boy is destined to
predecease him by 24 hours. With a plotline in the best tradition of Gilbert and Sullivan, musical wit that owes a debt to Offenbach, and parodies throughout of the bel canto stylings of Donizetti and Bellini, L'oile has an irresistible charm, tenderness, and satiric bite.

lead by director Jeff Reim along with Barrymore-nominated choreographer, Jody Anderson Miller. Musical direction is by Steve Weatherman, set design by John D. The latter opera is a reworking of Measure for Measure , which has been in production by the in Franklin, NY.  Its just a coincidence, but it did lead Glimmerglass and Franklin Stage to coordinate some of their publicity. Franklin Stage Company Measure for Measure , as staged in Franklin by David Bridel, is performed skillfully by a professional cast of four in multiple roles.  The story of a reformer whose crusade to stamp out vice leads him into his own temptations, critics have long felt that Shakespeare began M for M as a high-minded
morality play but may have rushed it to conclusion in the guise of a melodrama.  Its one of those works that makes some people suspicious about the authorship of Shakespeares plays, whose inconsistencies may be a sign of collaboration. ‘We are commemorating this year the tenth anniversary of the death of our founder, Calouste Sarkis Gulbenkian, and we wish to mark this occasion by commissioning a musical work in his memory, not of a funereal character, but above all celebrating the generosity of M. Calouste Gulbenkian. We would like a
symphonic work, preferably with chorus, which would last either 45 minutes to fill half of a concert, or one hour and a quarter for an entire concert. With book, music and lyrics by Meredith Willson, this show tells a love story between a smooth talking salesman, Professor Harold Hill and a small town pretty librarian, Marian Paroo. Professor Hill original intent is to con the rural folks of River City, Iowa by promising to start a boys marching band, sell the town the necessary instruments and flee with the money before they ever arrive. Soon after he discovers that he is falling in love with the town librarian and is unable to go through with his plan. The Music Man features unforgettable songs like: eventy-Six Trombones,ill There Was

Kriss, with the help of Bryan Bedford (Dylan McDermott), Dorey's neighbor and would-be-suitor, decides to teach them to accept who he claims to be. Mrs. Doubtfire Because of the unprecedented financial windfall his presence has brought to Cole's, Kriss becomes the focal point of a power play by the owner of a rival department store (played by the so-easy-to-dislike Joss Ackland). The aim of Shopper's Express is to discredit Kriss by having
him declared insane. This leads to a trial where Bedford, as Kriss' attorney, must try to prove that his client is the real Santa Claus. To satisfy a constitutional requirement that he marry, Ouf has selected as his bride the neighboring Princess Laoula, who arrives accompanied by Ambassador Hisson, his wife, and his secretary Tapioca. Enroute, Laoula has caught the eye of the young peddler, Lazuli, who sinks into despair when Hisson, to provide diplomatic confusion, refers to Laoula as his wife. Shakespeare isnt heard much these days.  But back in the summer of
1937 audiences were treated to a season
unparalleled in broadcast history.  The NBC and CBS
networks found themselves in competition to see who could present the most and best of Shakespeare.  Some of the great Shakespearean actors of the time, including John Barrymore and Orson Welles, were in the cast of radio
productions that included The Tempest , Twelfth Night ,
Taming of the Shrew and, of course,
