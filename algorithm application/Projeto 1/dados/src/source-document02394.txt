I like your website, the reviews are very good and helpful but I need help in comparing a Clavinova CLP 330 to a CLP 240 both at the same price!

Thank you for your question. It's a good question because both the CLP 240 and CLP 330 have advantages and disadvantages of their own. The advantages of the CLP 330 over the CLP 240 are as follows: * 128 notes of polyphony (vs. 64) * New 3 level piano voice * More song memory for storing compositions * USB port for saving songs to USB device * Brand new model The advantages of the CLP 240 over the CLP 330 are as follows: * 28 voices (vs. 14) * 40W x 2 (vs. 20W x 2) With price being equal, I would personally go with the CLP 330 due to more of its advantages. If you want more sound out of the CLP 330, you can always attach more powerful external speakers to the CLP 330's AUX OUT port. Hope that helps! , yamahamusician.com
