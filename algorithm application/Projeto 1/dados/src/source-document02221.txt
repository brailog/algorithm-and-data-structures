Council Tax
Council Tax is a property based tax paid to the local council.
If you live in a property which is divided into self contained flats then each flat will get its own Council Tax bill.
If you live in a shared house or flat the property is usually considered as one dwelling and will receive one bill.You are exempt from paying Council Tax if you live in Halls of Residence or in a house or flat wholly occupied by full time students.
The local council will need to see an Exemption Certificate, which is issued to you by the Campus Centre on enrolment, confirming your student status and course of study. You will be issued with a Council Tax Exemption Certificate in your first year to cover the duration of your studies.  Copies are available at the Campus Centres should they be required.
What if I live with people who aren't full time students?
If you live with people who are not full time students then the property will be billed for Council Tax.  If you rent or own a property jointly with other people then all the joint tenants or owners share responsibility for paying Council Tax.
Some people however may be eligible to apply for Housing Benefit or Council Tax Discount from their local council.
