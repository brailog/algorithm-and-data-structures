Next was an escort trip with Independence (CVL-22) and Guest (DD-472) to Trinidad, B.W.I., where the carrier trained her air group.Upon her return to Norfolk, Sigsbee refueled and with Guest and Earle (DD-635) escorted Lexington (CV-16) to Trinidad arriving on 16 May.    
 On 8 June, the destroyer was detached from the group and proceeded independently to New York.Sigsbee operated between New York , Casco Bay, and Norfolk until 22 July.On that date, the destroyer, with Harrison (DD-573), Daly (DD-519), and Lexington, stood out of Norfolk en route to Pearl Harbor via the Panama Canal.The canal was transited on 27 July, and Sigsbee arrived at Pearl Harbor on 9 August.   
 In mid-August, Sigsbee joined the task group built around carriers Yorktown (CV-10), Essex (CV-9), and Independence (CV-22) commanded by Rear Admiral C.A. Pownall for raids against Marcus Island in which considerable damage was done to enemy installations.Sigsbee returned to Pearl Harbor on 8 September 1943.

In April, Sigsbee patrolled the entrance to Humboldt Bay until the 26 when she screened a convoy to Cape Cretin.On 13 May Commander Gordon P. Chung-Hoon USN, relieved Commander Russell as commanding officer.After patrolling in the Guadalcanal area for several weeks, Sigsbee joined TU 53.1.14 to take part in the Mariana Islands campaign.The destroyer bombarded the Guam beaches during the period 16 to 18 July as well as covering the underwater demolition teams on the beaches.She then joined the picket screen and remained off Guam until 3 August. Sigsbee returned to Humboldt Bay for a month and then joined TF 77, proceeded to Morotai Island, North Moluceas, andprovided fire support for the landings on Cape Podangi in mid-September.th

The port engine was knocked out of commission, the starboard engine could only be run at five knots, steering was lost, and much of the main deck was awash.   
Sigsbee was towed back to Guam by the ocean going tug Munsee, where she was sufficiently repaired to enable her to make the voyage to Pearl Harbor.The destroyer arrived there on 17 June and had a complete new 60-foot stern installed.
