Posted at on by ,2: 3 PMJun 25, 2003 sgpage #2460
I have been taking 20mg Zocor (simvastatin) for 14 mos post heart attack/stent placement(2) in L. ventricle. About 2 monts ago I developed severe muscle pain and weakness in right forearm/elbow, left elbow, dexterity problems in the hands from time to time. I have had for some time; a burning sensation in the right leg, foot cramps, fuzzy vision and other symptoms. I am also taking other drugs; atenolol, lisinopril, asprin and venlafaxine, so they all had their part.
