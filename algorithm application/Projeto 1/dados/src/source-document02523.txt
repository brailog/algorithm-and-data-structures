In Dhaka, a group of philosophy enthusiasts have recently formed a society called the Aristotelian Society. Unlike the exclusively academic British society of the same name, its objective "is to popularise the study of philosophy. The society proposes to enroll both professional philosophers and amateurs, academics and non-academics and women and men from different walks of life who share an interest in philosophy." The Aristotelian Society is based at B Block, Lalmatia, Dhaka. It is not Dhaka's first popular philosophy initiative, however, as a study circle called the Dorshon Club has been operating for the last seven years. Its President, Dr Liaqat Ali, hosts weekly discussion meetings which over the course of a year work their way chronologically through the history of philosophy from the pre-Socratics to present, taking in Indian and Islamic philosophy along the way. The Dorshon Club is located at 7/A Paribagh.
