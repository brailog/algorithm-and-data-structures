Zoloft
Zoloft is commonly used to treat depression, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and other conditions. It belongs to a class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The medication works by balancing serotonin levels in the brain, which often helps with symptoms of depression and similar conditions. Common side effects of Zoloft include dry mouth, insomnia, and nausea.

How Does It Work?
Zoloft is part of a class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or  for short. SSRIs act on a specific chemical within the brain known as serotonin. This is one of several chemicals used to send messages from one nerve cell to another.
SSRIs
 
As a message travels down a nerve, it causes the end of the cell to release serotonin. The serotonin enters the gap between the first nerve cell and the one next to it. When enough reaches the second nerve cell, it activates receptors on the cell and the message continues on its way. The first cell then quickly absorbs any serotonin that remains in the gap between cells. This is called "reuptake."
 
Normally, this process works without any problems. But when the levels of serotonin become unbalanced, it can cause a variety of conditions, including depression and panic disorder. Zoloft helps to block the reuptake of serotonin so that more remains in the space between the brain's nerve cells. This gives the serotonin a better chance of activating the receptors on the next nerve cell.
 
Effects of Zoloft
Zoloft has been studied in numerous clinical trials for several conditions. Clinical studies have shown the drug to be effective for treating , , , , and in adults. Also, long-term studies showed that people taking it were less likely to have a relapse. depression OCD panic disorder post-traumatic stress disorder social anxiety disorder

The second study looked at using it only for the last two weeks of the menstrual cycle. Both studies showed that Zoloft was effective for treating PMDD. oral contraceptives birth control pills
