Solar Power Group GmbH
Advanced technology for solar thermal power generation
As the successor to the Belgian company Solarmundo, the Solar Power Group (SPG) has the experience of ten years of development of solar thermal Fresnel collectors at its disposal. SPG is currently developing new breakthrough technologies for energy generation by solar thermal means. At the same time, it also continues to receive important results from its research collector at Plataforma Solar de Almer a which allow it to carry out continued optimisation and development.
Together with MAN Ferrostaal, SPG is conducting projects across the sun belt and on all continents. These dont just pursue the generation of electricity from solar energy but also the generation of steam and its application such as in industrial processes, absorption coolers and in desalination plants.
