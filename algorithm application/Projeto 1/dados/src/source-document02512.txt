Business Valuations
Book value is not accurate and it almost always differs from Fair Market Value. If the machinery/equipment is not valued properly, the entire business valuation is skewed. Lots of liability!

Buy/Sell Agreement
When assets from a business are sold, fixed and tangible assets often must be valued separately from the business' intangible assets.

Financing/SBA Loans
Businesses often use their tangible assets as collateral to support loans. Often, the loan amount is derived from 40% to 60% of the value of the pledged assets. To obtain the maximum loan amount, a business owner would need to provide a certified appraisal report.

Insurable Value
It is undoubtedly necessary for a business to purchase liability insurance in the case of an event such as a fire or a theft. However, in most cases of an event, the business has to rely upon the value given by the insurance company, because the business owner did not obtain certified values of the business assets. In many cases, the insurance company will write a check for far less than the true replacement cost simply because the business owner could not provide an independent and substantiated value(s) to the contrary. Further, if the assets were used as collateral, then the tangible assets would need to be appraised properly to cover their value in the case of loss.

Litigation
Being dragged into court is nothing anyone wants to think about. But in our litigious age, it is a reality that must be prepared for, whether the suit is filed or could be due to the nature of a particular business or the nature of people.
