Election Cartography
Election Cartography- See it with Maps
Welcome to Election Cartography! This site is only for electoral maps of my creation. I will not entirely copy another person or site's maps.
Hopefully, through this site, you shall be able to notice a few trends in elections worldwide.
Enjoy!

Not Dead!
It's been a long time since any updates, but hopefully I'll continue soon enough- I'm currently having lots of other things to do right now. I'll try to add some (late) Scottish and Welsh maps, as well as a ton of French maps.
