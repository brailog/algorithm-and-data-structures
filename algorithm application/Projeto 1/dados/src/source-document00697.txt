[] edit Structure
The long, narrow medullary cavity is enclosed in a strong wall of compact tissue which is thickest along the interosseous border and dorsal surface.
At the extremities the compact layer thins.
The compact layer is continued onto the back of the olecranon as a plate of close spongy bone with lamell parallel.
From the inner surface of this plate and the compact layer below it trabecul arch forward toward the olecranon and coronoid and cross other trabecul , passing backward over the medullary cavity from the upper part of the shaft below the coronoid.
Below the coronoid process there is a small area of compact bone from which trabecul curve upward to end obliquely to the surface of the semilunar notch which is coated with a thin layer of compact bone.
The trabecul at the lower end have a more longitudinal direction.
