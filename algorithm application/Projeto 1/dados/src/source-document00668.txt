[] edit Criticism
Many noble ideas are either difficult or impossible to implement in free societies. Unfree societies point up their successes in this area (using labels like "Social Justice," and so forth) however when government controls prices, wages, industry, and the media these claims are easily made. Advocates of Equal Pay are quick to broadcast the disparity between women's pay and men's pay, but there are valid cultural reasons for it which have little to do with discriminatory sentiment or conduct. In any case, government actions to correct gender pay disparity, such as investigations of pay discrimination which compel employers to justify compensation to workers, serve to interfere with the substantially benevolent system of voluntary exchange.
[] edit Opponents
Obviously, people who oppose the very idea of women in the workforce are opposed to Equal Pay as well as any other social engineering that advances the idea. In the United States, very small religious groups such as the Amish may oppose this opinion but do not gain significant political power from it.[] citation needed
The U.S. Republican Party has rejected the idea of legislating or adjudicating equal pay across genders, insisting that public policy can't address social ills by changing outcomes.[] citation needed

Chairman Mao Tse-tung (1955): "Men and women must receive equal pay for equal work in production."
The U.S. Democratic Party (2008): "When women still earn 76 cents for every dollar that a man earns, it doesn t just hurt women; it hurts families and children. We will pass the 'Lilly Ledbetter' Act, which will make it easier to combat pay discrimination; we will pass the Fair Pay Act; and we will modernize the Equal Pay Act."
