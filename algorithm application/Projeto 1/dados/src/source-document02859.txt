The IGS (International Global Navigation Satellite Systems Service) is a voluntary federation of more than 200 agencies worldwide that pool resources and permanent GPS & GLONASS station data to generate precise GPS and GLONASS products.     The goals of ESA's GPS-TDAF system include:
Build and operate of a network of high-precision geodetic GPS receivers at ESTRACK station sites, including communications to ESOC
Development of related software
Development of services related to processing GPS data, solving for the orbits of the GPS satellites, station positions and motions, and Earth orientation parameters
Monitoring of variations between GPS satellite clocks and ground receiver clocks
Active participation in the IGS
Ionospheric mapping in near-real time for ESA tracking stations, providing support to all ESA satellites being tracked from these sites
Orbit determination for Earth satellites equipped with on-board GPS receivers
