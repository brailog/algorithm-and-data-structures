The Shaw Mansion is an example of an upper class eighteenth century home, unusual in that it is built of stone. It served as the Naval War Office during the Revolutionary War.
Our current exhibit, “ ‘Den of Serpents’: New London in the Revolution”, highlights some of the privateering activity that operated out of New London during that time, as well as the burning of New London by Benedict Arnold in 1781 in retaliation for that activity.
We welcome school groups, fifth grade and higher, for guided tours of the Mansion. Group tours are scheduled at least two days in advance. Thursday is the best day for us to focus on your group.
Guest speakers and focused programs on a variety of subjects related to New London County's history and cultures are available and tailored to your group's needs.
To reserve a tour date and time, discuss a focused educational program, or book a lecturer for your event, please call us at 860-443-1209.
