A History of Hope
When our family member Blue was affected by canine cancer, we wanted to do something about it. So in 2003 The Blue Buffalo Foundation for Cancer Research was founded to accomplish several important goals: The Foundation itself identifies the most promising institutions and distributes the funds generated by the Pet Cancer Awareness (PCA) program. The BLUE Buffalo Foundation is very grateful for your interest and help in finding a cure for pet cancer. Learn more about Blue Buffalo pet food .
