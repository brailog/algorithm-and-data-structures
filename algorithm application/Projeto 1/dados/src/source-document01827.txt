DRU Scenic 80 Slim Line, a panoramic flame picture
The popular DRU atmospheric fire, Scenic 70 Slim Line is now available in a larger version: the Scenic 80 Slim Line. In this new fire, with glass on three sides, not only does the atmospheric element play an important part, but the heat output is also considerable and suitable for a more spacious living room. Because of the three-sided glass window, the beautiful high flame picture is visible from almost any position in the living room.
The Scenic 80 Slim Line can be mounted on the wall and, if required, equipped with a natural stone shelf. It takes up no floor area creating a spacious effect. The back wall of the fire is a black polished plate, which accentuates the large yellow flames. The Vario Burner® system uses separate burners that create a natural log fire display. Using the remote control which is supplied as standard, the flame height can be adjusted as required. Functions such as a timer and a timer programme can also be supplied as standard.Features
Because heat collects in the chimney breast, the surplus hot air has to be removed. DRU can supply many different ventilation kits for this purpose. These come in different designs that can compliment any living room. As an optional extra, some of these kits can be provided with lighting for additional atmosphere.Accessories
