About Panciuto
When Panciuto opened in 2006, it did so with the goal of providing our customers with simple, creative and memorable meals in a comfortable dining room with attentive and friendly service.   Always committed to sustainable and local agriculture we have, since opening, become even more dedicated to using products from the freshest locally available meats and produce possible.  Local and sustainable are not terms reserved only for special dinner events at Panciuto, but are the guiding principles used every evening in every meal.  I think you will find the menu at Panciuto is recognizably Italian with a measure of Southern inflection.  The intimate scale of our restaurant and our relatively small menu allows us to give each and every dish the proper quality and attention the food and our guests deserve.
 
As for where the restaurant name comes from, Panciuto, pronounced pan-choo-toe, literally translates as "potbellied", but has come to represent a simple term of endearment.  We chose this name to honor a great friend, Duke Edward, who had an impressively large spirit and potbelly.   The following farmers supply our restaurant with the best produce and meats available.  You can find many of them at the Durham, South Estes or Carrboro Farmer's Markets.   They are: Fickle Creek Farm
