Our Veterans memorial pages dedicated to our family members who served their country and their cause and are now at eternal peace
 
Our American soldiers fought for our freedom, yes, but mostly they fought for their families - that they might practice their religion, traditions and customs free from what they felt was the tyranny of the enemy; they fought for their communities that they might continue to exist; and they fought for their buddies that they might live.  On occasion, they fought for complete strangers in foreign lands that those people might also have peace.  The soldier while in service does not have the option of questioning the wisdom, or the right or wrong of his war.  He must follow the legal orders of his commanders.  This places the moral imperative on the politicians, leaders and commanders who put the lives of our soldiers in harm's way to ensure that the fight is righteous, unavoidable and necessary.   Our country's leaders must remember that the blood of the injured and dead, both military and civilian, is on their hands; they must answer to the final judge for the lives of the soldiers and citizens damaged or lost in war.
Too often our leaders take this burden too lightly.
On these pages we recognize our family members who have served in American wars from the French and Indian War to the War on Terror.  Both sides of the Civil War are represented for the same reasons - those mentioned above.  The wars listed below are intended to represent eras, not just a specific war.
