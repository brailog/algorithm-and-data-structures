To determine the frequency of different outcomesin women participating in cervicalscreening. Analysis of screening records from 348 419women, and modelling of cases of cervical cancer and deaths withand withoutscreening. Cervical screening programme inBristol. For every 10 000 women screened from 1976to 1996, 1564 had abnormal cytology, 818 were investigated, and543 had abnormal histology. One hundred and seventy six had persistentabnormality for two years or more. In the absence of screening80 women would be expected to develop cancer of the cervix by2011, of whom 25 would die. With screening 10 of these deathswould be avoided. Comparison of cumulative abnormality rates withnumbers expected to develop cancer in the absence of screeningsuggests that at least 80% of high grade dyskaryosis and of highgrade dysplasia would not progress to cancer. The lifetime riskof having abnormal cytology detected could be as high as 40% forwomen born since1960. Screening is labour and resource intensive.It involves treatment for many women not destined to develop invasivecancer. The increased intervention rate for cervical abnormalityin England is due to change in practice, not a cohort effect,and is probably the reason for the marked fall in incidence andmortality during the 1990s. For other cancers there is scope formajor iatrogenic harm from screening because of invasive testsandtreatments.Objective:

Conclusions:
Since the mid-1980s incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer in women born since the 1930s in England and Wales has fallen; screening is the most likely explanationWhat is already known on this topic
For each death prevented many women have to be screened and many are treated who would not have developed a problem
In the NHS cervical screening programme around 1000 women need to be screened for 35 years to prevent one deathWhat this study adds
Over 80% of women with high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia will not develop invasive cancer, but all need to be treated
For each death prevented, over 150 women have an abnormal result, over 80 are referred for investigation, and over 50 have treatment
Before the 1988 relaunch of screening with strict quality standards, for each death prevented there were 57 000 tests and 1955 women had abnormal results
We carried the projections forward to 2011 because abnormality detected at screening theoretically predates invasive cancerby up to 15 years. The cumulative total tested in each cohortwas used for the forward projections and as the denominator forconverting numbers to rates. By assuming that the recent downturnin deaths is entirely a screening effect, and that lifetime riskis higher in women born since 1950, we ensured that we did notunderestimate the benefit of screening. We then compared theseestimates with the incidence of abnormality detected atscreening.

Cervical screening inevitably detects abnormalities that will never progress to life threatening disease. This createsalarm for healthy women and dilemmas for clinicians advising them.By the late 1990s the cervical screening programme was responsiblefor averting an estimated 800 deaths annually in women under 55years in England or 1300 deaths in all women in England andWales. 1   2 3
Recognition that benefit for some comes at the price of harm for others has prompted considerable debate about the informationwomen need for understanding what screening offers. Nationalguidance confirms that the purpose of information about screeningis to ensure that participants can make a fully informed choice. Nevertheless, public belief and the perceptions of journalists,politicians, lawyers, and many health professionals still reflect30 years of simplistic messages used to encourage attendance forscreening. 4-7 8 9 4 10-12
Accurate information about the consequences of screening is needed to assist participating individuals and to inform policyon preventive strategies nationally and internationally. Suchdata have not previously been published for cervical screening.We used records from a cytology database and cancer registrationand mortality data to derive information aboutoutcomes.

Cervical screening in the Bristol area (corresponding now to four primary care trusts) began in 1966. In April 1996, 244 535women aged 20 to 64 years were registered with Bristol and Districtgeneral practitioners. During the period covered by this analysis,all contemporary national guidance was complied with and reportingranges for abnormal results were within national recommended ranges.Women were invited for testing every five years from the age of24.
The Avon cytology database holds records for all women with smears processed by the two screening laboratories and by privatelaboratories in Bristol from 1976. Careful record matching hasensured there are no duplicate or fragmented records on the database.Up to 31 March 1996 the database contained test results for 351331 women. We excluded data on 498 women with unknown date ofbirth and on 2414 born before 1911 because they were older thanthe recommended age for screening in 1976. This left 348 419 recordsfor inclusion in thestudy.
We performed analyses separately for eachfive year birth cohort. Combination of these results gives an"average" experience across all ages and cohorts during the 20years of calendar time; those for a single cohort give more specificinformation, but for less than half of the screening agespan.Cumulative incidence analysis
 
Large numbers of women leave and join any cervical screening database because of age, change of address, change of generalpractitioner, and decisions about whether or not to be screened.We analysed incidence rates during the 20 years by looking atfive year periods and for each period used the total number ofwomen having tests during that five years as the denominator.We used the full past record for each woman, up to the end ofthe five years in question, to determine the first and worst occurrencesof abnormal smear test and biopsy results. A new occurrence ofabnormality was defined as the first occurrence of the worst gradein a woman's record, taking her entire record from April 1976up to the end of the five year period under analysis. Table shows the descending hierarchy for classifying worst. The cytologycategories correspond to the national cervical smear report form(HMR101). Borderline change has been used as a result categoryby the Bristol laboratories since 1981. Mild dyskaryosis has beencoded separately from moderate since June 1990 and subsequentdata show that 39% of women in the combined "mild and moderate"category had had at least one test result recorded as moderatedyskaryosis. Adenocarcinoma of the cervix was lower in the hierarchythan cervical intraepithelial neoplasia because the programmeprimarily detects squamousabnormalities.  1
To ascertain the frequency of persisting abnormality detected at screening we analysed the length of time between first andlast abnormal result for every woman for the full 20 years. Thetotal number with results in the 20 years was the denominatorfor expressing these data asrates.
Modelling of expected cases and deaths
We estimated the numbers of cases and of deathsfrom cancer of the cervix that would have occurred in the absenceof screening in the study population up to 1996 and projectedthe estimate for a further 15 years to 2011. To do this we appliedadjusted age specific incidence and death rates for England andWales to the cumulative numbers tested within each birth cohortand each five year period. The adjusted rates assumed that withoutscreening incidence and mortality would have followed the agespecific pattern exhibited by the pre-1930s birth cohorts in Englandand Wales (in whom there is no evidence of a screening effect)and that the absolute risk would have risen in cohorts of womenborn since 1950. Evidence for this increase in risk in cohortsafter the 1950s comes from national cancer registration and mortalitydata, serological prevalence data relating to high risk exposureto human papilloma virus, and age specific first detectionrates for severe dyskaryosis.Numbers of cases and deaths if screening had not taken place

 Numbers and rates of women with abnormal cytology and abnormal histology per 100 women tested since 1976 for those screened in 1991-6Table 1.**
We estimated the numbers of cases and deathswith screening in the study population by applying unadjustedincidence and mortality for England and Wales by age and by birthcohort to the cumulative numbers tested within each birth cohortand each five year period. Because all cohorts nationally arenow well screened there are few data on which to model incidencepredictions beyond 1996. For our study population we predicteddeaths with screening by assuming that after 1996, 60% of themodelled deaths without screening are averted. This is based onthe finding that in 1997 over 60% of deaths from cervical cancerin women under 55 seemed to be prevented by screening. Itis highly unlikely that detection and treatment of cervical abnormalitiesduring 1976-96 in our study population could have yielded greaterbenefit than thisestimate.Numbers of cases and deaths with screening

The numbers of women tested rose markedly during the first three five year periods from 109 000 to 232 000 and fell by around7% to 215 000 in the fourth period, although population uptakewas maintained at 87%.
Among the 214 582 women with an adequate testduring 1991-6, 33 552 (15.6%) had abnormal cytology, 17 558 (8.2%)had a record of biopsy, and 11 656 (5.4%) had abnormal histologydetected at any time during the 20 years of the study (table ).In addition, 26 818 women (7.7% of the total) had no abnormalresults but required an early repeat test because one or moresmears were inadequate forexamination.Cumulative incidence

The most comprehensive data were those for women born 1956-60. Among these women 4914 (17.6%) had abnormal cytology, 2733(9.8%) had a record of biopsy, and 2063 (7.4%) had abnormal histology(table ) at any time during the 20 years of thestudy.  1
Persistent or recurrent abnormality over a period of more than two years occurred in 6130 women (1.8% of all tested), and1845 (0.5%) had abnormal results for over five years. There wasa steep increase in detection rates over time (fig ). For example,in women aged 40 (on average) the rate for those born in 1946-51(tested 1986-91) was almost six times higher than for those bornin 1936-41 (tested during 1976-81). These two cohorts would notbe expected to have such major differences in lifetime risk. Changein the risk profile of women attending screening and removal oflesions by treatment cannot explain the difference. This leavesreversal of abnormal cytology and changed diagnostic thresholdsas the major explanations. Diagnostic criteria for severe dyskaryosisremained relatively stable. The corresponding difference inrates of severe dyskaryosis alone was more than fourfold. 1   1

The modelling predicts that without screeningand for all women in the study population 2774 (7.96 per 1000)would have developed invasive cervical cancer by 2011, 878 (2.52per 1000) of whom would have died from it (table ). For womenborn in 1956-60 in the absence of screening 538 (11.76 per 1000)would have developed invasive cervical cancer by 2011, of whom127 (2.78 per 1000) would have died fromit.Modelling of expected cases and deaths

By 1996 the modelling predicts that 192 fewer cases and 27 fewer deaths would have occurred in the study population as a resultof screening, assuming that reductions seen nationally in incidenceand mortality apply equally in Bristol (table ). Table alsoshows cumulative numbers of deaths from cervical cancer in thestudy population if 60% of deaths after 1996 are averted becauseof screening.

 Estimated cumulative numbers of women in study population expected to develop, or die from, invasive cervical cancer during each test period and for further 15 years into future, without screening (adjusted rates) and with screening (unadjusted rates). Expected deaths with screening beyond 1996 assume 60% of deaths after 1996 are prevented by screeningTable 2.
For each 10 000 women screened from 1976 to1996, 1564 had abnormal cytology, with 554 of these being highgrade (moderate dyskaryosis or worse and query glandular neoplasia);769 underwent repeat testing because of inadequate smears butwith no abnormality; 818 underwent biopsy (385 had high gradeabnormality or worse (invasive or microinvasive squamous carcinoma,cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II, cervical intraepithelialneoplasia grade III, adenocarcinoma), 158 had low grade abnormality);and 176 had persistent abnormal results over more than two years(fig ). Without screening an estimated 80 women would have developedcervical cancer by 2011 of whom 25 would die. According to themodelling, screening of 10 000 women during this 20 years anda further 15 years beyond would prevent 10 of the 25 deaths.Combined consequences, benefits, and harms

Outcomes per 10 000 women for cervical screening in study population, 1976-96, and for modelling of cervical cancer cases and deaths up to 2011Fig 2.  
From these data 13 000 (348 419/27) women needed to be screened over 20 years to prevent one death up to 1996, which wouldrepresent around 57 000 tests ((13 000 × 4) plus 10% for repeats).For each death prevented 1955 women had abnormal cytology (1564/0.8),of whom 1023 had biopsy. Incorporating future estimates of 60%mortality reduction from 1996 gives 1000 (348 419/357) as thenumber of women needing to be screened for 35 years to preventone death, involving some 7700 tests ((1000 × 7) plus 10% forrepeats). The ratio of abnormal results to deaths prevented cannotbe determined because the cumulative incidence up to 2011 is notyetknown.
By 2011, we estimate that without screening80 per 10 000 women would have developed invasive cancer. Therate of progression to cancer for high grade cytological abnormality(detected in 554 per 10 000) cannot therefore be greater than14.4% (80/554 × 100) as some cancers will arise in women whoseworst ever recorded result was mild, borderline, or negative.For histological abnormality, 22 per 10 000 had invasive or microinvasivesquamous cancer on biopsy and two had adenocarcinoma, which leaves56 of the estimated 80 cancers per thousand to arise from 228cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III and 133cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II (see table). The progression rate for grade II and III combined can thereforebe no greater than 15.4% (56/361 ×100).Progression rates

If we assume that mortality from cervical cancer has decreased by 60% since 1996, then 1000 women have had to be screenedfor 35 years to prevent one death. Put in context, a nurse performing200 tests each yearthe workload for two general practitioners'listswould prevent a death once in 38 years (7700/200). Duringthis time she or he would care for over 152 women with abnormalresults (1564/10.3), over 79 women would be referred for investigation,over 53 would have abnormal biopsy results, and over 17 wouldhave persisting abnormalities for more than two years. At leastone woman during the 38 years would die from cervical cancer despitebeingscreened.
Many attempts have been made to estimate regression, persistence, and progression rates for different grades of abnormality.Our comparison of the expected number of cancers by 2011 withthe number detected up to 1996 suggests that at least 80% of womenwith high grade lesions will not develop invasive cancer. Lowerascertainment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia may explainthe higher progression rates estimated in previousstudies. 15-18
Since 1987 deaths from cervical cancer in Bristol have fallen in line with national figures (Office for National Statistics,VS3). Hence high coverage and good quality control in the 1970sand 1980s did not result in a significant change in death ratesin Bristol before the national changes to the screening programme.This suggests that the reduction in mortality resulted from wideningdefinitions for categorising abnormality and the consequentincrease in numbers treated. Cytological screening may be so non-specificthat it is possible to prevent fatal cancers only by treatinglarge numbers ofwomen. 19
Our results are likely to apply to other comprehensive and quality assured cervical screening programmes. When screening ismore frequent than five yearly there may be more women with abnormalresults for each death prevented. In populations with a higherincidence of cervical cancer one would expect fewer women to belabelled and treated for each deathprevented.
These findings have important implications.First is the scale of the problem of overdetection. Even womenwho receive results of borderline changes can become anxious abouttheir risk of cancer. Figure shows that for younger cohortsthe cumulative lifetime incidence for any abnormality could reach30-40%. It is essential therefore that we change people's perceptionof the meaning of an abnormal screeningresult.Implications

Secondly, because of the resources involved and the potential to do harm, it is in the public's interest to control the introductionof inadequately evaluated or of inadequately quality assured cancerscreening. Our results show that cervical screening in Englandand Wales before 1996 entailed 57 000 tests and 1955 abnormalresults for each death prevented. Prostate specific antigen testingfor early detection of prostate cancer will involve similarlylarge numbers of tests and abnormal results and the net resultwill be major iatrogenic harm from invasive investigations andtreatments. We have a duty to protect the public from this damagingactivity until there is good evidence on alloutcomes.
Finally, our results suggest that over 80% of high grade dyskaryosis and of high grade dysplasia in the cervix does not progressto invasive cancer. This calls into question the prophylacticremoval of other organs (colon, ovaries, breast, oesophagus) andthe offer of potentially harmful chemotherapy and radiotherapytreatments for healthy people found to have dysplasia of thoseorgans. The net result could be harm because the absolute riskof progression in these tissues may below.
