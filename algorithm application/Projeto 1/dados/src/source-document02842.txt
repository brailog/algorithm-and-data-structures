About Us
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's interactive visual analytics provide new ways to ask questions and get answers, an essential element of new discoveries.
Working Solutions
With more than 10 years of visual analytics experience in research, engineering and product development, PNNL's efforts in visual information analysis spans from basic research to development of innovative tools and technologies. After assessing a client's unique needs, our interdisciplinary teams create and customize visual metaphors and information exploration tools.
We have applied our diverse capabilities in software engineering, computer science research, feature extraction, cognitive psychology, statistics and mathematics, linguistics, and human-computer interaction to solve problems for industry and government clients. We look forward to further developing and enhancing these tools and exploring new approaches to meet your needs.
Discovering the unexpected
Our research helps people identify trends, relationships and common themes within large collections of data that may include a large collection of documents, individual large documents, or information on the World Wide Web.
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is a DOE research facility and delivers breakthrough science and technology in the areas of environment, energy, health, fundamental sciences and national security. Battelle, based in Columbus, Ohio, has operated PNNL for DOE since 1965.
