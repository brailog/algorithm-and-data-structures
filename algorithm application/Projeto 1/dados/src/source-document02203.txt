Flora of Zimbabwe
Welcome to the November 2008 update of the Flora of Zimbabwe website!
This site provides information about the flowering plants and ferns of Zimbabwe and is a joint venture between Bart Wursten and Mark Hyde. We expect that it will also be useful for people living in neighbouring countries, namely Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa and Zambia as parts of their flora are similar to that of Zimbabwe.

This month's image is of an plant species, the first time we have featured one. It is , the Broad-leaved pondweed. The picture shows the leaves, which are relatively broad as the name implies, floating on the surface of a small pond. The inflorescence, an erect spike, is also in the picture although it is not easy to see against the background. Six species of have been recorded from Zimbabwe. They are widespread but not very often encountered; this one is probably the most common.aquatic Potamogeton thunbergii
