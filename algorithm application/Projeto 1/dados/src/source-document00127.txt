Renegade rock starBest known as:
One of the few Woodstock-generation rockers whose late career didn't rely on reunions and re-issues, Neil Young in the '90s earned the title "Godfather of Grunge", along with a new generation of followers. From his early days with Buffalo Springfield to his 1970s heyday with his band Crazy Horse, Young's plaintive voice and raw guitar earned him success with pop tunes, protest songs and even country ballads. After a series of experimental and commercially unsuccessful records in the '80s, Young returned to raw-edged rock and roll, making him a hero to bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam.
Young is a model train enthusiast.Extra credit:
