With a population of just 15,000 souls, Beacon is a small city in Dutchess County, New York, situated on the east bank of the Hudson River at the foot of Mount Beacon, some 59 miles north of New York City. The city wasn't incorporated until May 15,1913, when the old villages of Fishkill Landing and Matteawan were combined to form the City of Beacon (named after the Beacon fires lit at the summit of the Fishkill Mountains to alert the Revolutionary Armies about British troop movements).
