About the photos
I took the photographs in this section in 1971 on an Easter Week tour of Greece with a group of High School classics students from Southern California. Escorted by nuns (I was one of the only public school students in the group), our tour visited Athens, Delphi, Mycenae and Knossos. The photos were taken with a cheap Instamatic. I recently found these photos and scanned some of them to accompany this section   The photo on this page is the Temple of Poseidon at Sounion. Isadora Duncan danced there. I threw the last watch I ever owned into the sea from this promontory.   The photo on the works of Homer index page is the entrance to the Treasury of Atreus at Mycenae. A fabulous hoard of gold artifacts was found in it when it was excavated, including a gold death mask which Schliemann decided was that of Agamemnon. The interior is shaped like a beehive and has bizarre acoustics.   The photo on the Iliad index page is the arch of the Lion Gate at Mycenae; many of the key figures of the Iliad (if they actually existed) must have walked under this arch.   The photo on the Odyssey index page is a view of the Aegean which I took from the cruise ship taking us to Crete.   The photo on the Bulfinch index page is a panorama of the Acropolis.  The photo on the Aesop index page is yet another view of the Acropolis. Yet another view of the Acropolis.
