Patron Saint Festivals
Held in honor of the patron saints of island towns and cities, the “fiestas patronales” are popular annual festivities that take place in the town squares and include processions, games, rides, musical shows, and regional foods. Contact the Puerto Rico Tourism Company at La Casita Tourism Information Center in Old San Juan (787-722-1709) for information about current festivals.
Surfing
There are numerous world-class surfing spots in the Rincón/Isabela Area. Peak season is October through April, however virtually all year round, waves are breaking somewhere in Puerto Rico!
Whale Watching
Humpback whales may be seen in the winter from the observation park at the Rincón Lighthouse. The peek season is February, though the whales have been spotted from late December through late March. Just ask around the marina or the Lighthouse. In peak season, you may see them a few hundred meters off the Lighthouse.
