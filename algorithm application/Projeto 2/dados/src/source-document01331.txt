As voted by the Bloggers. It’s looking like New Feature won’t be up until Tuesday (I have this sinking feeling this is a lot of buildup for something mediocre, but there’s really nothing I can do til I get to my desktop back on campus).
In the meantime, however, ’s a link I’ve been meaning to share but simply haven’t for a variety of excuses. here
I think it’s a very neat idea; asking writers to submit what they believe is their most interesting article. I think it would be neater still to compare their choice to the choice of say, the readers. But that would be a potentially difficult poll to take.
You’ll recognize SNTC on there, as well as a host of other interesting sites. If I may brag, my featured article is probably the least political (if the silliest) of them all. Except maybe not, I ‘unno. Chapter 1 of the Summer Guide was not the best chapter, but I figure, start at the beginning.
And hey, if you think I picked the wrong article, let me know. I’m interested to hear what you think.
