General Facts about the best known Brass Instruments
Everybody who is interested in music knows what metal wind instruments are. They belong to a wide class of musical instruments, the aerophones, which are calles like that because, expressesd in a simple way, you produce the tone by blowing into a pipe. When you speak of music colloquially, you dinstinguish between wind instruments (trumpets, etc.) and woodwind instruments (flutes and pipe instruments). Compared to the systematics of instruments, however, the distinction is far more subtle. The organ is also classified as a wind instrument, whereas the accordion, the harmonium and the mouthorgan belong to the so-called free aerophones. The way you produce a sound when blowing the trombone is, for example, quite different from that of a trumpet.
