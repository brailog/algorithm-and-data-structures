   Case 1 Presentation
On postnatal day 12, nasal CPAP is discontinued; she is placedon nasal cannula oxygen and later is weaned to room air. Gavagefeedings using expressed mother's milk are continued and slowlyadvanced to full-volume feedings over 14 days. On postnatalday 16, human milk fortifier is added to expressed human milk.On postnatal day 28, a premature formula is used in additionto human milk for caloric supplementation. On postnatal day34, because of insufficient lactation, the infant receives prematureformula (24 cal/oz). She continues to tolerate her feedings,showing adequate weight gain.
On postnatal day 55 (33 weeks postconception), the infant beginshaving frequent oxygen desaturations detected by pulse oximetry,loss of head control, reduced swallowing with retained oralsecretions, and choking. Her symptoms persist despite supplementaloxygen by nasal cannula and head positioning. Bowel movementsdecrease from her usual three to four per day to one to twosmall smears. The baby's respiratory status continues to decline,with worsening episodes of apnea, bradycardia, and oxygen desaturations,and she is placed on nasal CPAP. She appears mottled and lethargic,with global hypotonia. Sepsis[]
