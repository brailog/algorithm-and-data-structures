"Look out, Jaws is here. Here's a second series of peddles. I'm gonna get a different mouthpiece I'm getting higher. I played peddles and then I'm playing all the notes that are available on the trombone from low E. It goes up a ways, here's D. So you've got, basically, the peddle octave, the low octave, the middle octave, the higher, in-between octave. You've got about four octaves to deal with and you can play Jaws on any one of the octaves. So those are some of the half-tones. If you know what that theme song is from some T.V. show or radio show, youre as older as I, or twice as old as I. That was the Jack Benny show, "Love and Blue" and he'd play it on his violin, he was very good actually. So that's all about the half-tone partials."
