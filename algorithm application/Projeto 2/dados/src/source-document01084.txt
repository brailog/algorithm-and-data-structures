Environmental Health
Fish are nutrious and good for you to eat. Most fish are safe to eat. But some fish may contain a chemical called mercury which can be dangerous to the body. According to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, nearly all of Wisconsinâ€™s 15,000 lakes and 57,000 miles of rivers and streams are under a general fish consumption advisory because of elevated mercury contamination levels. Usually due to a diet high in fish, mercury poisoning poses a threat to pregnant women and children under the age of 15 years old.Mercury in Fish

Hair Loss
Mistakenly thought to be a strictly male disease, women actually make up 40% percent of American hair loss sufferers. Hair loss in women can be absolutely devastating for the sufferer's self image and emotional well being. The psychological damage caused by hair loss and feeling unattractive can be just as devastating as any serious disease, and in fact, can take an emotional toll that directly affects physical health.

Lesbian Health
Lesbians have most of the same health concerns as other women. But lesbians have different ones, too. Lesbians have faced centuries of discrimination that posed a variety of health challenges. Today, with stronger community ties and support from LGBT community and health centers, many corporations, health organizations, and city and state ordinances and statutes, lesbians are more empowered to meet these challenges.
