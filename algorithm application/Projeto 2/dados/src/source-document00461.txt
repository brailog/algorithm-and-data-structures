Joint Orthopaedic Initiative for National Trials of the Shoulder
JOINTS Canada, formerly the Canadian Shoulder Research Group (CSRG), is an assembly of orthopaedic shoulder surgeons, epidemiologists, research coordinators, nurses, physiotherapists and kinesiologists who have a common interest in shoulder research. The organization was founded and established by Dr. Alexandra Kirkley in 1999. Dr. Kirkley organized the first group meeting with the following objectives in mind:
To improve the quality of life for patients with shoulder problems,
To develop an effective team approach to shoulder research in Canada,
To standardize systems for evaluating patients, and
To embark on funded multicentre trials.
Members of JOINTS Canada continue to meet every year at the Canadian Orthopaedic Association Annual Meeting.
