 
Welcome to the Ardens
Six fire trucks, four ambulences and other emergency vehicles rallied to protect this cultural icon. Every smoke alarm had gone off, suggesting the worst to the alarm company, which alerted the fire companies. No one was injured, the fire was confined to the boiler room, and smoke and water damage were minimal. Little if any smoke smell remains. The cause of the fire was two-fold, said Steve Cohen: a repair of the furnace was never finalized in spite of repeated calls to the heating contractor, and falling corrosion from the stone chimney had accumulated at the furnace, blocking the vent.
