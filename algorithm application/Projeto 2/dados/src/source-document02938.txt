The home solar power systems below all come with the two main components of any grid-connected system: Solar Panels and Inverters. The Solar Panels collect energy from the sun and turn it into electricity. The Grid-Tie Inverter, or simply Inverter, converts DC electricity from the Solar Panels and turns it into AC electricity that we use in our homes. There are many terms for Residential Solar Energy System such as Grid-Tie (tied into the energy grid), Residential Solar, and Home Solar, but they are all the same thing: a solar electric system that provides clean and renewable power from the sun. Now you have the option to monitor your solar home in real time via the web with Fat Spaniel monitoring. See the ASG Power Systems for more info on residential solar system monitoring.
