[] edit The patch
The patch worn by members of the Minnesota State Patrol evolved from "The Great Seal" which is placed on all official state documents. The design is similar to the territorial seal which was used from 1849 until the adoption of the State Seal in 1858. It depicts a man in the foreground plowing, while a Native American is riding into the sunset in the background. The picture on the seal is a scene near St. Anthony Falls, located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Motto "l Etoile Du Nord" was selected by the first governor, Henry H. Sibley, which translated is "The North Star", thereby making Minnesota, "The North Star State". [6]
