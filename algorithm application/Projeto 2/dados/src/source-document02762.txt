Fulfilling our company's mission to enable people to explore their worlds, and in partnership with the world-renowned Lowell Observatory where Pluto was discovered, Discovery Channel is building the world's next generation telescope. First light for this magnificent instrument will be in 2010 when viewers, scientists, astronomy enthusiasts and school children from around the globe will get a first look at discoveries from the far reaches of the universe. Television programming, online news and developments, as well as educational curriculum will be created to bring all of the exciting updates, images and scientific discoveries to the world.
