Physical Features of Brazil
To the traveler, Brazil offers infinite geographic diversity. Plains, lowlands, highland plateau, and mountain ridges unfold from the south to the north. From east to west a landscape is revealed that is covered with lakes, lagoons and rivers all eventually flowing into the Atlantic Ocean. The landscape of Brazil is characterized by five distinct regions:
Coastal Plain, also called the Atlantic Coast
Brazilian Highlands, also called the Central Plateau
Amazon Basin
The Pantanal, also called the Paranagua Basin
Guiana Highlands
 
Activity One: Topographical Map Assignment
Divide students into pairs, and provide each pair with access to reference material and the required map and data retrieval chart.
On the supplied map of Brazil draw and colour the five major topographical areas. Be sure to include the following:
Title.
A legend for the elevations.
Research each topographical area and describe its major topographical feature and how it is used today. Place finding on student created data retrieval chart.
 
Activity Two: River Drainage Basin Assignment
Divide students into pairs, and provide each pair with access to reference material, the required map, and a Venn Diagram.
Start with a discussion to review concepts of drainage basin, watershed, plains, escarpment, plateau, floodplain, levee, river cliff and meander.
On the supplied map of Brazil draw and colour the five major river drainage basins. Be sure to include the following:
Title.
A legend for the river drainage basins.
Colour and label the major rivers.
Research each major river basin and write finding on map under the labels. Research should include the names of the rivers that flows through the drainage basin and a description of the use the water is put to.
Match the River Drainage Basis map with the Topographical map. Have students complete a Venn Diagram to show the similarities and differences.
