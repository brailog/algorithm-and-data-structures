Hospitality and Tourism Pathway
Why Choose A Career in Hospitality and Tourism?
Think exotic resorts in the Caribbean, Fiji, Bora Bora and Mexico. Think about preparing and serving delicious food to hundreds of people each day. Think about planning trips for large groups or an individual couple. Think about dream vacations.
If you take off on the Hospitality and Tourism Pathway you could find yourself cooking in a five-star restaurant, running a quaint bed and breakfast, organizing conventions in major cities or sending honeymooners to exclusive island getaways.
If you want to help vacationers slow down and relax and serve them excellent meals, then this could be the pathway for you.
Are you interested in the art of food? Do you have dreams of becoming a great chef? Is recreation your area of interest? Do you like to keep meeting plans running smoothly?
Then consider a career as a cook or chef, restaurant hostess or waiter, travel agent or meeting and convention planner. Still not sure? Not to worry as there are more jobs focused on Hospitality and Tourism.
