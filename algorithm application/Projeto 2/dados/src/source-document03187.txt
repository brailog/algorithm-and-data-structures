By the late 1960s, however, MG had fallen victim to corporate  politics, as other cars from the British Motor Holdings (later British Leyland) stable took precedence over the MG product. Yet this is by no means the end of the story: in the early 1990s the Rover Group made the welcome decision to revive the MG as a sports car; fifteen years after the last MGB rolled off the production line. The new K-series engined MGF heralds the marque's jubilant comeback.
