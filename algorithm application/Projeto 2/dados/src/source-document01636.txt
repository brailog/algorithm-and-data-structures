- HORDE FESTIVAL review from Vintage Rock by Kenneth Wait : Irvine Meadows, CA - 7/17/97
"Just as the Horse are breaking full stride, Neil jumps like a bucking bronco into the acoustic section of his set with what, as near as I can tell, is an open letter to Stephen Stills to put their first band back together. It also seemed as though Dewey Martin may have been in attendance as Neil addressed him personally. 'Hey Dew! This note's for you.' From Hank to Hedrix to horseshoes, man -- Neil should know better than to try to sedate a crowd that he spent half the set trying to get pumped. Take my advice, open the show with the acoustic set (like you did in the 70's), and you won't lose the attention of half the drunks in the crowd. My ear drums, however, did appreciate the downtime. 'Helpless' and 'Slowpoke' closed out the 'quiet' portion of the evening -- the latter being fantastic, and the former featuring Frank on piano. Much like 'Powderfinger' and 'Hey Hey, My My,' familiarity breeds no contempt; on the contrary, the older it gets, the better it gets. "
