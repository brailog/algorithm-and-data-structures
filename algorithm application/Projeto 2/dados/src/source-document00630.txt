he beauty of Lake Las Vegas is the perfect backdrop for V.
Strolling over the reproduction of the Pontevecchio bridge, you'll be greeted by a combination of charm reminiscent of the Northern Italian lake region and the casual elegance of Tuscany in MonteLago Village. Quaint streets lead you to piazzas where you might enjoy a refreshing gelati or a steaming cup of cappuccino while you watch the gondolas on the lake. Days can be spent browsing the specialty boutiques or wandering through an art festival. Championship Las Vegas golf courses by Jack Nicklaus and Tom Weiskopf (and soon a new course by Tom Fazio) challenge golfers with terrain that varies from the mountainous landscape to the desert floor. A concert on the floating stage could be the romantic backdrop to an intimate dinner at a fine waterfront restaurants. And, if the Casino MonteLago, the AAA Five Diamond Ritz-Carlton, Hyatt Regency, and Spa Vita di Lago aren't enough to fill your evenings, the myriad stars in the clear desert sky are sure to entertain you with a dazzling show as you wander back up to your at V at Lake Las Vegas.
