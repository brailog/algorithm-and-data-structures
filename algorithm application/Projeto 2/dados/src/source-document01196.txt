For detailed histories of the carriers and their positions on December 7, please read the article itself.
On 7 December 1941, the U.S. Navy had seven aircraft carriers (CVs) and one aircraft escort vessel (AVG) in commission. The CVs were considered warships and  the AVG was considered an auxiliary vessel. In addition to these eight ships, the keels of five other CVs had been laid. 
As has been related endlessly, by a fantastic coincidence none of the carriers was at Pearl Harbor, and escaped the Japanese attack. While they sank or crippled much of America's battleship fleet, the Japanese achieved little, because it was the fleet carriers and not the battleships that were to win the Pacific war for America. Still, even had the Japanese sunk 2-3 carriers, at best they might have gained a year for themselves. America could not have taken the counter-offensive in 1942, but by 1943 it would have struck west when the new carriers started coming on line. The economic disparity between Japan and America was too great to be remedied by the potential sinking of a handful of carriers.
