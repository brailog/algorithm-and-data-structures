Carnegie Hall
Pickles!
Corned Beef on Rye with Cheese and Russian Dressing (I can't remember what the official name of the sandwich is)
There is a $13 plate sharing fee, which cracks me up because YOU KNOW everyone shares their sandwich there! Especially tourists who can't bring their leftovers home. They do serve extra slices of bread with the sandwhich, so you can create mini sandwiches off of the platter. We stuffed ourselves silly and had no room for cheesecake.
