This Ladle was chosen as Rachael Ray's "Faves" for May 2008 "Everyday with Rachael Ray" magazine. On his solid cherry wood utensils, Johathan says, "This is a hardwood with handsome color and grain, durable, smooth, and strong. My utensils have a unique sense of balance and warmth because they are designed with the hand and purpose in mind. "Spoons" have become spatulas, tongs, spaghetti forks, spreaders, and more. Today I offer a natural cherry finish, a flame-blackened surface with a sanded edge to reveal an accent of warm cherry wood, as well as flame-blackened stripes and spots". made in Pennsylvania
