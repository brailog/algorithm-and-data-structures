Frommer's Review
If you're growing tired of your travel partner, I recommend Doc Cheng's. The witty menu tells the story of Doc Cheng, a mythological colonial figure who was a sought-after physician, local celebrity, and notorious drunk. His concept of "restorative foods" is therefore rather decadent, on the menu you'll find fabulous "fusion" dishes that are more flavorful than medicinal. Guest chefs make the menu ever changing -- the latest and greatest, a trio of beef cuts prepared in three different styles (Western, Indian, and Chinese) on the same plate, or the unique and mouthwatering Sichuan rack of lamb. The house wine is a Riesling (sweet wines are more popular with Singaporeans) from Raffles's own vineyard. Two dining areas allow you to dine alfresco under the veranda or in cool air-conditioning inside.
