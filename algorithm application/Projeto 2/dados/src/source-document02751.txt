Has Current Solved the User Generated Advertising Mystery?
Web 2.0 Summit Current.tv multiple multi-million dollar advertising deals non-professional commercials created by fans
Hyatt was joined on stage by Twitter co-founder Evan Williams, who once again repeated the "wait and see" answer when asked about his monetization strategy. Side-by-side with Current's success, Twitter's continued stalling seemed more unsatisfying than ever - but success in general felt more possible when we saw what Current has done.
Hyatt wouldn't disclose how many of these deals they've done or what kind of revenue the company has, but he did say that Sony, HP and Loreal were all advertisers. The audience today saw a pretty compelling example in a Prius commercial reportedly made by some guy who owns a Prius and likes it a lot.
Hyatt said that surveys show viewers prefer user generated advertising 9 to 1 over Madison Avenue's creations. Anecdotally, though, we know that recent history is littered with examples of campaigns where a trickle of users produced a handful of boring ad segments for uninspiring products.
