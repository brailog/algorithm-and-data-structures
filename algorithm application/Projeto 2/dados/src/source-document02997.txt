A Brief History of Rice
Rice is a food that has been a favorite of families and cultures for a long time. Rice is one of the most consumed foods that have ever existed, and trends project this to continue into the future.
The history of rice as a food staple dates back to 2500 B.C. Of course, it was probably consumed long before that date! The documentation begins in China and moves to other areas. It seems that, as people traveled around, they shared the benefits of rice as they went. It was also likely that traders had a great deal to do with its spread.
Eating rice originally caught on because it is a crop that can be grown in many regions. It provides a significant amount of energy, and perhaps most importantly, it can be stored for long periods, providing a cushion in lean times and a store of value in good times. Historians have documented the different places that adapted rice into their culture as a part of their studies.
