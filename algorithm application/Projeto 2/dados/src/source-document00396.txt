What is it?
Cable is a high speed broadband internet service that lets you:
access the internet without affecting your phone (or fax) line or your Foxtel Pay TV connection
download large files fast - enjoy high-bandwidth content like streaming media and online games
BigPond Broadband Cable uses the Telstra HFC Network, which is the same network that carries FOXTEL's PayTV service. And you can still watch Foxtel and use the phone or fax while you're online.
 
Do you feel the need for speed?
Whether you’re snowboarding down a mountain at lightning speed, or trying to make the most of your time online, it’s easy when you have the right equipment. BigPond Broadband Cable Extreme offers downloads of up to 117 times faster than a 256kbps ADSL service, and up to three times as fast as cable standard. Now that’s an extreme rush!1
Once you have chosen your preferred cable service, you can have a look at the Home Network Gateway (Wi-Fi modem) and standard modem options available for connecting to the internet.
