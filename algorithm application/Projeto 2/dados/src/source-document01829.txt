Date: Tue, 12 Sep 2006 09:44:23 -0400 Subject: RE: USS Yorktown CG-48 Mr. Watts, Below are the responses to the questions submitted in an e-mail dated Aug. 30. Please let me know if you have any other questions. Thanks, Katie Katie Dunnigan Public Affairs Officer Naval Sea Systems Command 202-781-3350 katie.dunnigan@navy.mil Q1. Can you tell me about the status of the ship? How will it be disposed and when? A1. The ex-USS Yorktown is a decommissioned inactive ship at the NAVSEA Inactive Ship Maintenance Office (INACTSHIPMAINTO) in Philadelphia, Pa. The ship is designated to be sunk as a part of a fleet sinking exercise. The date and location have not been set yet. Q2. What is the current state of the ship? Has everything been stripped off already? Are the missile launchers and the guns still onboard? A2. The Navy is in the process of preparing the ship for sinking. Most of the weapons systems have already been removed from the ship. Q3. Is there any way we can some souvenirs off the ship? A3. Unfortunately, the Navy cannot permit veterans, or any individuals, to remove material from the ship. The Navy is only authorized by law to donate material to eligible non-profit organizations for educational display purposes at no cost to the government. Q4. Do you have any current pictures of the ship that we can have? A4. Unfortunately, the Navy does not have current pictures of the ship available. Thanks to Mr. Watts for sending that information.
