About Us
Our mission is simple: to make it as easy as possible for parents and students to take lessons with a great teacher.
Encore Music Lessons was founded in New York City on October, 27, 2005 and opened its door for business on February 1st, 2006. In just two years, we've matched over 50,000 students with great teachers throughout New York City, New Jersey, Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia.
In May, 2008 we launched our new, national, state-of-the-art website, offering two teacher directories -- one for students who want in-home lessons and one for students who prefer to go to a teacher's studio -- making it easier than ever for students and parents to find the perfect local music teacher.
