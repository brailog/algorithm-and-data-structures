New In Flames Album Art - Like It Or Hate It?
So In Flames announced their track listing and album artwork for their upcoming album, A Sense Of Purpose, a couple days ago. The artwork was done by , who I’m pretty sure is from SF and is friends with some fellows which makes him OK in my book.

There has been a lot of positive and negative feedback so far around the blog world and various forums. I have some definite opinions, mostly negative, but a few kudos as well - however I’m much more interested in hearing what you folks think.
So leave a comment. Tell me and all the other folks reading this blog what your opinion on this bright, colorful twist to the legacy of In Flames album art. Too cliche? A welcome turn for the sunny side? Let’s hear it.
