One fast way to rid your yard and garden of animal pests is to trap them live and have them escorted from your property. In some cases you can do this by yourself, but you should check with your local animal control authorities first. Laws in many areas regulate trapping, since animals may be protected, other people may not want to deal with your relocated pests, or the relocated animals may spread disease to a new area. In addition, some animals can harm you: A skunk could douse you with its stinky spray, for instance, or a rabid raccoon could give you rabies. If trapping is legal, your local animal control office may provide you with a trap to use.
