Destined for festivals, exhibitions, and touring programmes in Brazil and abroad, these curated programmes make important works circulate, and they also make known, in broad circuits, the history of art from the geopolitical south of the world, from its origins to the more contemporary trends. Created by Solange Farkas, curator of the Festival and president of Associao Cultural Videobrasil, these selections are based on one of the largest electronic art collections in Latin America. In addition to retrospective programmes, artist compilations, and touring programmes of past Festivals, the selections also include curated programmes that shed light on the production of given regions and/or promote a dialogue between different proposals and practices.
