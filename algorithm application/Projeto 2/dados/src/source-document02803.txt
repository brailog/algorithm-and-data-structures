Leaf Insect, an insect with wings that resemble leaves in both color and shape. The wings also have veins resembling those of leaves, and in many species the legs look like twigs. This appearance protects leaf insects from enemies, as it is nearly impossible to see them when they are on the plants whose leaves they resemble. Leaf insects are native to the tropics of the Eastern Hemisphere.
Leaf insects make up the family Phyllidae. There are about 50 species, most in the genus Phyllium.
