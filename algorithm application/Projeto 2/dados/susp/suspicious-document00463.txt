I'm 49 and have had knee trouble all my life. I have done those big squats in my 20's and 30's (500lb+). I gave up squating at 39 and for the last 9 years I suffered with
aching knees and was afraid to
squat. I have been doing Super Joints for the last 6 months (have not missed a day). No more pain no discomfort. The pain may only come on from use of the muscle with the tendon or when more severe may be constant, especially noticeable at night.     X-rays may be taken to examine the site for bony ab normalities or evidence of arthritis. Some people have an unusual anatomy in which the bone around the tendon reduces the space between it and the tendon. X-rays will indicate this, and will also reveal any bone spurs around the tendon. If the tendon area is noticeably swollen, your doctor may want to take fluid out of any related joint to test for infection.   A test called an may be used if your physician suspects a tear of a tendon around a joint. Joints can be damaged by many types of injuries or diseases. or simply years of use may cause a joint to wear away. This can cause pain, stiffness and swelling. Over time, a swollen joint can become severely damaged. Arthritis Treatment of joint problems depends on the cause. If you have a , treatment often begins with the RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation) method to relieve pain, reduce swelling and speed healing. Great for old, creaking joints--or young ones Rated 10 out of 10 As a 54 year old who just refuses to give up on martial arts, lifting and the entire lifestyle, this was really a great addition to my "keep the parts moving" arsenal. Some of these movements I recognized from Yoga, but many were at least
a new twist (no pun intended) on things that have added quite a bit to my stretching and joint maitenence efforts. I very strongly recommend it. - Sayville, NYSteve Corso (scors50)   How is tendonitis typically treated?   This condition requires multiple approaches to treatment, since it has multiple aspects. No one treatment approach will address the whole problem. Traditional research on the subject focuses just on the condition or pathology and is diagnosis based. My treatment approach is whole problem and whole person based and deals with the problem from multiple directions. How well
treatment works will still
depend on the mix of factors involved in any
given individual. One time miracles happen but mostly it a long term process, especially to prevent future problems.   Often people try to endure their pain. They hope that it will simply go away. Unfortunately, more serious symptoms may begin if these early symptoms are ignored. The occasional pain will change to constant aching, pain, and stiffness before, during, and after exercise. The tendon will also become tender to touch. The initial degeneration will alter the mechanical environment, and mechanical damage to the tendon due to extrinsic or intrinsic factors will increase, which will in turn alter the mechanical environment, increasing mechanical damage, and the cycle continues, initiating a tear. Bursal, joint
and tendon tears are often found
at the time of surgical repair and the causes for these tears are unknown.    Several subcategories have been identified: (1) hypoxic degeneration, (2) hyaline degeneration, (3) mucoid or myxoid degeneration, (4) fibrinoid degeneration, (5) lipoid degeneration, (6) calcification, and (7) fibrocartilaginous and bony metaplasia. A major issue is that tendinosis is not necessarily symptomatic. The role of physical activity on the presence of tendinosis is not clear, even though it appears that ultrasound changes are present in asymptomatic patellar tendons of a proportion of elite athletes, but rarely present in non-athletes. There are also less common, but serious, side effects, such as a or , , or an allergic reaction. heart attack stroke congestive heart failure   (Click for more information, including serious side effects to look out for.) NSAIDs Side Effects   There are also certain groups of people who may
be at a higher risk of side effects while taking NSAIDs (such as those with or stomach ulcers). These people should take NSAIDs with caution or not at all. heart disease   (Click for more information, including a list of people who should not take these drugs.) instead, Cortaflex provides the body with the specific amino acids and saccharides (Glutamine, Glucuronic Acid, Glutamic Acid, Glycine and Proline) which are the building blocks of these compounds - your body can then actually make its own glucosamine and chondroitin. This is why Cortaflex is so much more effective than any glucosamine and chondroitin supplement. In other words in , the (large) molecules of Chondroitin and are already broken down into the (smaller molecule sized) Amino Acid isolates and Aminosaccharides allowing more efficient absorption of the key
nutritional ingredients into where they are needed - the cells in the cartilage of the joints - to promote healthy joint function. .Cortaflex Glucosamine For more information on this mechanism click here Human Cortaflex Human Cortaflex comes in two forms - the (normal!)
