When I lived in the UK, my "car" was a little unusual, in that it was an ex-MoD Series 3 109" Land Rover. The British Army took delivery in January 1973, making it a little older
than myself. After being passed around the regiments and a couple of stints in Northern Ireland during the 1970s (probably as a reserve vehicle), it joined the Gurkha Rifles where it stayed until being de-mobbed in 1989.

Wilks then decided, along with his brother , the general manager at during this
time, that Rover should invest in an off road utility vehicle for farmers. Thus, the Land Rover was
born. His first Land Rover was made in 1947, a hybrid built on a Jeep chassis using a Rover car engine and gearbox but retaining the Jeep transmission. This metal's resistance to corrosion was one of the factors that allowed the vehicle to build up a reputation for longevity in the toughest conditions. It is reckoned that 75% of all those ever built are still in use. In fact, Land Rover drivers[13] sometimes refer to other makes of 4x4 as "disposables". The early choice of
colour was
dictated by military surplus supplies of aircraft cockpit paint, so early vehicles only came in various shades of light green; all models until recently feature sturdy box section ladder-frame chassis. One Ton

Land Rover is a company created by Rover, which in the 80s, these two had many financial problems. So before falling into bankruptcy, the German firm BMW took over

The Land Rover was designed as a civilian replacement for the US Jeep, manufactured by Willys-Overland and Ford. Steel was still strictly rationed after the war, and as a consequence all Land Rovers were (and Defenders still are) built with aluminium body panels. This is one reason why the older generation Land Rovers and the ever-popular Defender models still hold their value because the body panels themselves are not prone to corrosion. The solution was to adopt long-travel coil spring
suspension, the long coils allowing the large range of axle movement needed (up to 11 inches) while providing a far more sophisticated ride. In order to ensure that all this axle movement was available, a single Boge Hydromat self-leveling hydraulic strut was centrally located between the rear axle casing and the chassis frame. Coping with the high power output of the
V8 engine also necessitated some careful thought in the transmission and
braking
departments. Every day,
Defenders are helping to
save lives, deliver medical care and service industry in areas that only a
Defender can survive.
