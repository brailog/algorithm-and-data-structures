prepared for the home buyer, documenting the results of the
inspection, along with an estimation of repair time frames and

We often hear the question "How much is a property like this one worth?", and the answer is that every property is unique. Since your residence is not in the same place
in the building, doesn't have the same light as any other, and so on, the exact value can never be known, all anyone can make is an estimation, which is why different peoples opinions vary so much.
