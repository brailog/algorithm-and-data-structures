Madnia says his next step will be to identify just how detailed these simulations can become. While Madnia and his team focus on the basic character of flames, the implications of their work may someday answer questions in combustion-engine design. Hopefully, he says, the models could be used to replicate the basic features and details of flames in complex combustion systems. add this texture Now invert the texture (Ctrl+I) and change its hue by going to Image > Adjustments > Hue and Saturation.

Al- though strength and
power are represented, the dragon above all is a reconciliation of opposites, a combination of YIN AND YANG. Also unlike the Western dragon, the Oriental dragon is not a cunningly malevolent beast. Instead it is strength combined with wisdom and is benevolent. This image has changed over time, it became a wholly bird-like creature eventually, but the story has remained the same, and is seen in art as being immersed in flame so as to begin its transformation.

No other creature in the world could have produced such a far-reaching influence on the mind of man. Unlike the European dragon, it was considered a
beneficent beast, until the Buddhists introduced the concept of evil dragons.
