longer than any other biography known
from ancient history, having some 82,000 words ([Burr.WAG, 169] - and I would add, it is rather tedious reading); it contains geographical, historical, and ethnographical information of the type found in "sophistic novels" of the time (ibid., 172); and finally, it has the traits of both novel and romance. Clearly equilateral triangles and squares can be constructed, that is, inscribed in a circle. Bisection allows any number of doublings, e.g. hexagons and octogons. The inscribed pentagon is a more challenging construction. This book is devoted to the circumscribing and inscribing regular and irregular polygons into circles. For example, IV-5.     For historical information Herodotus had to rely on the priests, the people who knew how to read Egyptian in all its forms and often had access to ancient writings. On the whole, the priests' knowledge was not very reliable and did not gain by Herodotus' recounting.     The Egyptians had a number of Nilometers, one of them at Memphis, another at Elephantine, where they measured and recorded the height of the river.   The photo on the works

The Academy of Plato operated in Athens for almost 600 years, and served as educational center even for some of the early fathers of the Christian church.

Apollonius visited Ethiopia and expressed the wish that it would be splendid if wealth were held in less honor, and equality flourished a little more. He cited Aristides as an example of a just person, for he fixed the tribute to Athens on a fair basis and returned home in his same poor clothes; but after his death excessive valuations and heavy tributes imposed on the islands led to the Peloponnesian War.
