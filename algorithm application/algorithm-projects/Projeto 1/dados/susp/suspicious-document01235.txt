Culpeper Regional Hospital will remain an independent, not-for-profit hospital with an independent board of trustees. Our Veterans memorial pages dedicated to our family members who served their country and their cause
and are now at eternal peace Â  Our
American soldiers fought for our freedom, yes, but mostly they fought for their families - that they might practice their religion, traditions and customs free from what they felt was the tyranny of the enemy; they fought for their communities that they might continue to exist; and they fought for their buddies that they might live.Â  On occasion, they fought for complete strangers in
foreign lands that those people might also have peace.Â  The soldier while in service does not have the option of questioning the wisdom, or the right or wrong of his war.Â  He must follow the legal orders of his commanders.Â  This places the moral imperative on the politicians, leaders and commanders who put the lives of our soldiers in harm's way to ensure that the fight is righteous, unavoidable and necessary.

It is our hope that in the near future we can find a way to restore the cemetery to a state as close as possible to its original condition. We have promise of some help in this
endeavor. Â Â Â Â Â  We want to thank Harry
Morrison and the owners of the land for giving us the opportunity to visit this cemetery.History of Gibson County Sometimes they set a man in the midst, and about him they dance and sing, he all the while clapping his hands, as if he would keep time, and after their songs and dancings ended they goe to their feasts."
