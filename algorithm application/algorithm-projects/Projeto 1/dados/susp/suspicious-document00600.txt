In order to support the Ministry of Public Health, local governments and other institutions involved in nutritional
education, UNICEF
provides them with educational materials about eating and nutrition.These materials emphasize the consumption of iodized salt, which is
fundamental for the prevention of goiter and cretinism. It also promotes the use of iron supplements during pregnancy and the first
years of life, as well as the administration of vitamin A to children between six months and three years in public health services, when they receive vaccines.Until 2004 UNICEF supplied iron supplements and vitamin A; since 2005 they have been in the budget of the Ministry of Health.

It has been stated that 2/3 of children and women of child-bearing age in
developing countries suffer from iron deficiency, 1/3 suffering from
severe
deficiency and anaemia. In developed countries, between 10-20% of child-bearing age women are said to be anaemic. Iron is the
least plentiful
nutrient in the typical
British
diet and anaemia is fairly common in the UK. Dietary Sources Dietary iron exists in two different forms. Haem iron only exists in animal tissues, whilst in plant foods iron is present as non-haem iron. In a mixed omnivore diet around 25% of dietary iron is non-haem iron. Iron is an
essential nutrient involved in a variety of biological processes in the ocean, including photosynthesis, respiration and nitrogen fixation. Atmospheric deposition of aerosols is recognized as the main source of iron for the surface ocean. In high nutrient, low chlorophyll areas, it is now clearly established that iron limits phytoplankton productivity but its biogeochemical role in low nutrient, low chlorophyll environments has been poorly studied. In reality, what most Americans need to do is increase their
bodily levels of lactoferrin, so that the iron from the foods they eat --- --- is more thoroughly assimilated.which is more than adequate for the human system In fact, as Dr. Peter Rothschild points out in his recently published research report on the Biology of Lactoferrin, "Of the 750 million people on this planet who suffer from iron deficiency symptoms, less than half of them suffer from any actual lack of iron in their diet." enhances the absorption of nonheme iron and must be consumed with iron at the same
meal. Vitamin C Inhibitors of nonheme iron include phytates and oxalates. Phytates are present in whole grains and legumes
while
oxalates are present in vegetables like spinach. protein, polyphenols found in some fruits and vegetables, , and wines, also inhibit the absorption of
nonheme iron from the food. Soy coffee
tea To get enough iron, a
wide variety of foods rich in iron should be consumed. Iron(II) oxalate (FeCO) is used as yellow pigment for paints, , and ceramic, and in .24 plastics glass photography (FeSO) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a in the production of , as an ingredient in fertilizer and , as an additive in
animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to to increase iron levels. Normally, the liver stores iron for the essential purpose
of
providing new red blood cells with iron. This is necessary for life and good health,
however, when excess quantities are stored in the liver, it becomes enlarged and causes serious damage to the tissue e.g.(cirrhosis).
This can subsequently lead to cancer of the liver and premature death, if the condition is not diagnosed and treated. As well as liver disease, other serious conditions can be caused by excess iron: In the
general population in Australia, at least 1 person in 300 is likely to be affected by haemochromatosis during his or her lifetime. Mixed or complex meals (i.e., meals of several food items) generally do not inhibit Fe
absorption.
In contrast, Ca may inhibit Fe absorption in mono-meals (the practice of mono-eating is recommended by some raw vegans)
depending on the food eaten.Calcium (Ca) Freeland-Graves [1988], citing Bindra [1986], reports that dietary fiber might inhibit Fe absorption. Hurrell [1997], citing Rosssander [1992], reports that fiber has little effect on Fe absorption. Free radicals may inflame and damage coronary
arteries, the blood vessels
that supply the heart muscle. This inflammation may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by partial
or complete blockage of one
or more
coronary arteries. Other
researchers suggest that iron may contribute to the oxidation of LDL ("bad") cholesterol, changing it to a form that is more damaging to coronary arteries.

Iron is the sixth most in the , formed as the final act of by burning in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the , the is believed to consist largely of an iron- alloy
constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant
element
on Earth, but only the fourth
most abundant element in the Earth's crust. Most of the iron in the crust
is found combined with as minerals such as and . And because it is attached to lactoferrin, the iron cannot be absorbed and utilized by the bacteria, viruses, yeasts and other harmful parasites that require
it for their metabolism. These harmful organisms are simply unable to capture and utilize iron in the presence of lactoferrin! What all of this means, according to Dr. Rothschild, is that "one of lactoferrin's primary functions in the human body is to act as a first line of defense against all invading pathogens." The Dietary and Nutritional Survey of British Adults revealed that one third of all women had low iron stores. Symptons of iron deficiency
anaemia
include tiredness and breathlessness especially on physical exertion, giddiness, palpitations, headache and poor
concentration. Studies of British vegans have reported an average intake of
approximately
double the recommended Reference Nutrient Intakes. At this level of iron consumption, any
possible
inhibitory effects of fibre and phytate on absorption are unlikely to be important. As vegan diets contain about three to four times the British and US recommendations for vitamin C, absorption of iron is enhanced. The normal stomach produces hydrochloric acid, which influences the absorption of thyroid hormones. Research has shown that taking drugs that inhibit the production of stomach acid reduces the absorption of thyroid hormones. Conversely, people
with low stomach acid
who take betaine hydrochloride for "acid-replacement therapy" would be expected to have an increase in their absorption of
thyroid hormones. For that reason, people taking thyroid hormones should not take betaine
hydrochloride without the supervision
of a doctor, who can determine whether a change in thyroid hormone dose is necessary. Babies, toddlers, preschoolers and teenagers are
at higher risk of iron
deficiency,
because their increased needs for iron may not be met if their diet is not balanced. Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia in children starts with dietary change but may include iron supplements (under medical supervision only). Date:   Better Health Channel Description:   Causes of iron deficiency in adults include inadequate dietary intake, chronic
blood loss (through menstruation or other causes), times of increased need such as
pregnancy,
inability to absorb or properly use iron and vigorous exercise. The United Nations University is an organ of the United Nations established by the General Assembly in 1972 to be an international community of scholars engaged in research, advanced training, and the dissemination of knowledge related to the pressing global problems of human survival, development, and welfare. Its activities focus mainly on peace and conflict resolution, development in a
changing world, and science and technology in relation to human welfare. The University operates through a worldwide network of research and postgraduate training centres, with its planning and co-ordinating headquarters in Tokyo, Japan. The Whittington Hospital in London, UK, has
successfully gained

FerriScan, enabling clinicians to utilise FerriScan in the routine clinical care of patients with iron overload. There are over 15,000 people
suffering
from sickle cell disease, thalassaemia major or myelodysplastic syndromes in the UK many of which suffer from iron overload
as a result of regular blood transfusions. The same can occur with
elements in food, such as . Absorption of iron is better at a low pH (an acid environment), and resorption is decreased if there is a simultaneous intake of antacids, phosphates, etc. tetracycline penicillamine methyldopa levodopa bisphosphonates quinolones calcium from foods, such as and
, reduce absorption of iron. Tannins tea saw palmetto Taken after a meal, there are fewer side effects but
there is
also less absorption because of interaction and pH alteration. Generally, an interval of 2-3h between the iron intake and
that of
other drugs seems
advisable.
