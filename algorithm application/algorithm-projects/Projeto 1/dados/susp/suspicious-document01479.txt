December 7,
please read the article itself. On 7 December 1941, the U.S. Navy had seven aircraft carriers (CVs) and one aircraft escort vessel (AVG) in commission. The CVs were considered warships and  the AVG was considered an auxiliary vessel. In addition to these eight ships, the keels of five other CVs had been laid.  He obtained Public Works Administration (PWA) funds for the purchase of new aircraft and additional air stations.  By 1936 the Coast Guard had six air stations, two air detachments
and 42 aircraft. Also during the 1930s, the marriage between the cutter and aircraft took place.  The 327-foot cutters embarked either a Grumman JF-2 or Curtiss SOC-4 [left, with USCGC Bibb] amphibians.

The Aster
missile has a 13kg warhead and a range of 30km. The missile's guidance is inertial with data uplink and active radar terminal homing. For increased manoeuvrability in the terminal phase, the missile uses a 'PIF-PAF' direct thrust control system with gas jets.
