better; everything they did wrong on
the 5200 Super
System. Atari tried to find out what the fans of video-games expected from a new system. So they made interviews with thousands of people to gain some ideas for their new project called 'Atari 3600'. Later it was renamed to 'Maria'. Atari ordered the GCC (General Computer Corporation) to design an improved chipset for their new system with enhanced colors and graphics. The chipset was called 'MARIA'. The new console also should support a
keyboard add-on which would convert the 7800 into a fully grown 8bit-computer. Atari threw away the weird controllers of
the 5200 and designed the new ProController, the CX24 (in Europe, the 7800
was shipped
with the Atari joypad-controller (CX78)) and they made a smaller case for the 7800. Forum Do you

unfortunately no hardware was ever released to take advantage of it. Some later
versions of the 7800 have
compatibility problems with a select few 2600 cartridges, most notably Robot

Sayed Islam The Hardware Debate So it's been one of the oldest debates in gaming - Does hardware make you a better player? If you listen to ads from Logitech, Nvidia, and other
retailers, they will tell you that you will lose big time without their latest
and greatest chips and mice. The system recognized the 7800 cartridges by the added
authentication / encryption-key. By using the authentication / encryption-key, Atari wanted to control the games released for the system. If they
thought a game to be not good enough, they just wouldn't provide the key. If
the system didn't detect any authentication / encryption-key, the console switched to the 2600 compatibility-mode. Due to military
export-restrictions, the 960bit-encryption was ONLY used on the US-version of the 7800!  There also was the plan to produce the 'Slam-Pam'. An add-on for the
Atari 5200 that would provide full 7800 compatibility for this machine! The 7800 was ready to hit the market... But when
the Tramiels bought Atari, something terrible happened: the 7800
was shelved, because the Tramiels wanted Atari to become a leading company in the home-computer business and they didn't see any need to build and market
game-consoles! Nearly three years later, in 1986, Nintendo and Sega were ruling the video-game market. Atari thought that it now (!) would be the right time to release the Atari 2600jr
and the Atari 7800 ProSystem, both developed three years ago.   Contents and pictures 1999 - 2004 by 'www.atarihistory.de' unless otherwise noticed Similar to an NES
