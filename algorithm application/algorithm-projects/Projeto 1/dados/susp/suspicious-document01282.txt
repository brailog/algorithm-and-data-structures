On the longest day of the year, the June 21st summer solstice, the rising sun appears behind the 'Heel Stone' - one of the main stones, creating the illusion that it is balancing on the stone. The Heel Stone sits along a wide lane called the Avenue. The rising Sun creeps up the length of the rock, creating a shadow that extends deep into the heart of five
pairs of sarsen stone trilithons -- two pillar stones with one laid across the top -- in the shape of a horseshoe that opens up towards the rising sun. In 1973, a coalition of Creole and Javanese parties gained power and began a campaign for independence, which was achieved in 1975. In 1980, the military seized power from the elected civilian government. Though a demoncratic government was established by the 1987 constitution, the military continued to have much power and influence into the 1990's. In 1992, Bush Negroes ended a six-year guerilla war when the government agreed to provide them with new economic-development and social-welfare programs. | << Previous Next > Tempur-Pedic® technology has changed the way we work, live and now, sleep.

Seychelles (in full: Republic of Seychelles), an island country in the Indian Ocean near the Equator, some 1,100 miles (1,800 km) east of Africa. It consists of about 90 volcanic and coral islands, totaling 171 square miles (444 km 2 ). Most of the people are of mixed African and European descent and live on the largest island, Mahe. The capital and only sizable city is Victoria, on Mahe. They built plantations along the coastal plain
and brought in
African
slaves to work them. The colony was officially ceded to the Dutch in 1667, but a long series of wars and treaties shifted it between the English, Dutch, and French during the next 150 years. Slave uprisings and Indian attacks added to the colony's difficulties. Permanent control was finally gained by the Netherlands in 1815. Slavery was ended in 1863. After that time much of the work on plantations was done by Asian immigrants and their descendents.
