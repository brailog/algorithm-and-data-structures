Our volunteers interview and educate prospective adopters on the importance of proper veterinary care, nutrition, exercise, and obedience training to ensure a
successful adoption for everyone involved. Another important role of LDCRF is to reach out and educate the general public on the plight of homeless animals, the benefits of adoption, and the importance of spaying/neutering your pet. We participate in various community activities and events to expand community awareness. As part of our community outreach and education program, LDCRF will conduct educational seminars at local schools, community centers, or other locations. These seminars may be scheduled upon request; for more information please e-mail . education@lostdogrescue.org History The Lost Dog Café, located at 5876 Washington Blvd. in Arlington, VA, has rescued, sponsored and placed hundreds of abandoned and unwanted animals over the past 13
years.
In the spring of 2001, the
owner's of the café, Pam McAlwee and Ross Underwood, decided to increase the number of animals saved by forming their own rescue foundation. This is how the Lost Dog & Cat Rescue Foundation came to exist. McAlwee & Underwood also work on the Lost Dog Ranch in Sumerduck, VA ( to take a virtual tour) , where they keep displaced dogs, and ones the foundation has saved from shelters, until they can find homes for them.

Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules Introduction The (144 KB) (published in January 2000) identified the need to establish a European Community-wide framework for official controls. The resulting Community Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 882/2004) was
devised to provide a more comprehensive
and integrated, risk-based, EU-wide, "farm to
table" approach to official
controls in
the areas of feed, food, animal health and
animal welfare. Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 aims to improve the
consistency and effectiveness of official controls across the European Community and consequently to raise standards of food safety, consumer protection, prevention of the spread of animal diseases, the humane treatment of animals, and to provide a greater degree of transparency for consumers about enforcement arrangements. Regulation
(EC) No 882/2004 deals with arrangements for the monitoring of compliance with, and the enforcement of, feed and food law and animal health and animal welfare legislation. By the very fact of owning a dog you open up your home to be bombarded by a myriad of different little health problems. Some of them might not be so bad, but for the most part if you have a dog health problems will also abound. You just can stop that. It as natural as breathing, and although you might take steps to prevent this, there really only so much that you can do, and so much germs and bacteria that you can fight.
Additionally, tooth problems are more likely if your dog eats mostly soft foods, because these leave debris in gum pockets at the base of the teeth, leading to infections. These not only cause problems for your dog's teeth - studies show that a whopping 98% of cases of bad breath in dogs are caused by periodontal disease, which is the result of tartar build-up and gum infections. The best way of preventing these problems is with regular brushing of your dog's teeth. D2003-14 Dear Daisy Dog Max, our 11-month-old German shepherd, is limping again. About four months ago, it was his right front leg, and now hes limping on his left front. The vet says its growing pains. Just what are growing pains? Can this condition be prevented? How is it treated? Daisy Responds The fancy term for growing pains is panosteitis ( pan-os-tee-ite-us ), also called pan-o.
This is a bone (oste) inflammation (itis)
affecting the long bones of the legs. The disease usually strikes young, large-breed dogs, especially German shepherds. Males are more commonly affected than females. Radiographs (x-rays) can help diagnose the disease and rule out other causes of lameness, such as fractures. Most dogs recover without treatment, though the disease sometimes recurs, as it did in Maxs case. The good news for Max is that panosteitis is usually gone by two years of age. The cause is unknown, so specific treatment and preventive measures are unknown. Most dogs are given anti-inflammatory pain relievers to ease the discomfort. independent powers for auditors to enter farmers' and other businesses’ premises and to inspect documents in order to carry out audits of enforcement activity by a competent authority; the Secretary of State to require audits of Local Authorities; Food Standards Agency (FSA) auditors to enter premises, inspect documents etc, when carrying out audits on behalf of Defra; inspectors appointed by the Secretary of State, and by Local Authorities when exercising their existing powers of entry, to bring with them European Commission experts and officials from other Member States' competent authorities;

In addition, he invades our yard and attacks our dog. We like our neighbor, but we cant get the message across that her dog should not run loose. What can we do? Daisy Responds I wouldnt want to live with a biting dog, but if your neighbor chooses to, the least she can do is protect others from her canine terrorist. If talking hasnt resolved the problem, photocopy this column and send
it to her. Attach a petition signed by others in your neighborhood. If that doesnt work, contact the authorities. I live in Pennsylvania, and under our Dog Law, any dog that attacks a human without provocation  even once  can be declared a dangerous dog. When this occurs, the owner must confine the dog and post a warning, complete with a symbol recognized by children. When the dog is off his property, he must be leashed and muzzled. In addition, the dogs owner must pay a $200 registration fee and carry a $50,000 insurance policy. Dogs that bite give all of us a bad name. Where will the cat go
