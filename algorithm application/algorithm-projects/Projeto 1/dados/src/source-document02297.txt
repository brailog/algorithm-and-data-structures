is darker and more dramatic than the two previous features--or the broadcast series. Inu-Yasha's father Inu no Taisho, the Great Dog Demon, possessed not two but three swords: Tetsusaiga, Tenseiga, and Sounga, which are linked to Earth, Heaven, and Hell, respectively. After the human princess Izayoi gave birth to Inu-Yasha, she was killed by Takemaru, a samurai who loved her from afar. Inu no Taisho died soon after; the sword smith Totosai and Myoga the flea hid the first two swords, according their master's instructions, and sealed away Sounga. Seven centuries later, Sounga has become one of the treasures of the Higurashi family shrine. During what should be an ordinary ritual, Sounga is freed and returns to the past through the Bone Eater's Well. The bloodthirsty spirit of the sword raises the soul of Takemaru and begins a campaign of hideous destruction. Can Inu-Yasha, Kagome, Shippo, Miroku, Sango, and Sesshomaru defeat the sword-ghoul--individually or collectively?Swords of an Honorable RulerInu-Yasha
