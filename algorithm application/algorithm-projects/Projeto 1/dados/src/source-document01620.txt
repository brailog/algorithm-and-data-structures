How, then, do we know that man has volition? It is a self-evident fact, available to any act of introspection. You the reader can perceive every potentiality I have been discussing simply by observing your own consciousness.

At each moment, you are deciding to think or not to think. The fact that you regularly make these kinds of choices is directly accessible to you, as it is to any volitional consciousness. The principle of volition is a philosophic axiom, with all the features this involves. It is a primary  a starting point of conceptual cognition and of the subject of epistemology; to direct one's consciousness, one must be free and one must know, at least implicitly, that one is. It is a fundamental: every item of conceptual knowledge requires some form of validation, the need of which rests on the fact of volition. It is self-evident. And it is inescapable.
