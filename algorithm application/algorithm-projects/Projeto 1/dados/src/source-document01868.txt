Sackbutt, sacbut, shagbolt, shagbutt, shagbosh, are all variant spellings of the English name for early trombone. The origin of this is probably "saquebute" (French) or "sacabuche (Spanish) both made up of "sac" (to pull) and "bu" (to push, German origin?). Posaune, the German name for the trombone came from bucine (or buisine or buccina) the Italian name for a sort of trumpet. Basun, the Swedish use this (same etymology as posaune) and their version of trombone: trombon. Other names that probably refer to the trombone are; draucht trumpet, tromba spezzata, tuba ductilis.3.

There is also a fine trombone from 1557 by Jorg Neuschel (also made in Nuremberg) on display at the Vienna Kunsthistorisches Museum. Early trombones were made in various sizes; Tenor or gemeine (common) posaune (A or Bb), Bass or quart posaune (from D to G), Double (contra) bass or oktav posaune (BBb), The alto is less common (Eb or F) Even rarer still, the soprano in Bb4.
