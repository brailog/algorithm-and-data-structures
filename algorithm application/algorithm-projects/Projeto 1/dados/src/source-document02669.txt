Answer
Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol is one of the three major types of lipoproteins. The other two are high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Each type contains a mixture of cholesterol, protein and triglyceride, but in varying amounts.
LDL contains the highest amount of cholesterol. HDL contains the highest amount of protein. VLDL contains the highest amount of triglyceride, a blood fat. Like LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol is considered a type of "bad" cholesterol because elevated levels are associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease.
It is important to know your VLDL cholesterol level. However, there is no simple, direct way to measure VLDL cholesterol. So VLDL cholesterol is usually estimated as a percentage of your triglyceride value. A normal VLDL cholesterol level is between 5 and 40 milligrams per deciliter.
By lowering your triglyceride levels, you also lower your VLDL cholesterol levels. Healthy lifestyle changes such as losing excess weight and exercising regularly can help lower triglyceride levels. Also, avoid sugary foods and alcohol, which have a particularly potent effect on increasing triglycerides.
