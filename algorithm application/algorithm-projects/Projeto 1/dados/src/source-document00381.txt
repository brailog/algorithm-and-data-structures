What is Hangul
Hangul is the Korean alphabet
Invented by King Sejong in 1443 during the Chosun Dynasty, Hangul is amazingly simple in form (basically squares) and scientifically structured therefore relatively easy for foreigners to learn. Because the number of strokes you need to worry about is only 24 (10 vowels and 14 consonants), you use the regular English computer keyboard to enter Korean characters. The overall square shape is so unique that you will never mistake Hangul for Chinese or Japanese.  Also, for those of you who may be tempted to think that Chinese, Japanese and Koreans all speak similar languages, no they don't. Each nation's spoken language is just as different from one another as their respective written language is. It requires a painstaking effort to learn each other's language (both written and spoken) just like it would for a native English speaker to learn French or German. Because Hangul is a non-Roman set of characters, you will need to , free from Microsoft, to view Korean on MS Office 2000 or on the Internet.   To learn more about Hangul,
