A typical 12 volt nominal module is 17 volts. A typical 24 volt nominal module is about 34 volts. To help identify modules that do not fit into these norms Affordable Solar has begun a non-standard system of identifying modules with unusual volts. These include 10v, 16v, 20v, and 48v modules. The Schott modules are listed as 50 volts nominal as per the data sheets, but this may be a different type of calculation than Affordable Solar's calculation. This designation system is only used by Affordable Solar as a tool to help identify potential design issues. To view our bulk specials please visit our
