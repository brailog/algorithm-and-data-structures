A young girl named Juna is nearly killed in a motorcycle accident. But she is called back by the mystic boy Chris. He gives her life back to her, but only if she fulfills her role as the Avatar of Time, and help purge the planet of a parasitic lifeform called the Raaja. The Raaja are wormlike lifeforms that can be as big as skyscraper or as small as a cell. They manifest in everything from fast food to nucleur reactors, and have one thought, to consume all life everywhere through human greed and arrogance. Juna becomes aware of all life around her and how it effects the Earth. Her relations with her family and friends are pushed to the limit as she gains a better understanding of the chain of nature. Dazzling CGI animation bring this story to life.
