by James F. Brieger is an information packed volume describing nearly every existing and extinct village and town in the state of Mississippi. It provides several paragraphs on each including its origins, founders and the history behind the naming of the town as well the logic behind its location as available.Hometown Mississippi
This much quoted book is out of print although the third edition was published as recently as 2000. This is a research volume and is only available in select college libraries and private collections. It is not a book to which most researchers would have access. However our lookup volunteer, Carole Barker, has a second edition and would be pleased to look up the information you may need.
Please be specific when making your request for lookups directly to MS. Barker by email. Click here to  email MS. Barker:
