Downloadable brochure on mountain biking on the Wayne
Welcome to the Wayne National Forest! The Wayne has many miles of trails available for mountain biking. In addition there are a variety of public roads which provide leisurely scenic rides for bicyclists. There are no trails designed exclusively for mountain bikes. Monday Creek (Athens RD), Hanging Rock (Ironton RD) and Pine Creek (Ironton RD) Trails are off-road vehicle trails where mountain bike riding is welcome. Kinderhook Trail (Marietta Unit) is a horse trail which also provides for mountain bikes. The remaining trails on the Marietta Unit are hiking trails where mountain bike riding is welcome. Depending on which trail you choose to ride, you may encounter off-road vehicles, horses, or hikers. When using roads, you may encounter local traffic, large trucks, and dogs. For a chart of available Mountain Bike riders need to be aware that on the ORV trail systems, ORVs have the right of way. You will be aware these vehicles are coming long before they can see you, so listen for them and yield the trail to avoid accidents. Likewise, on trails shared with horses, please yield to horseback riders by stopping your bike and dismounting uphill from the trail. Many horses are easily spooked by bikes, so be courteous of these animals and their riders. Terrain on these ORV trail systems varies from rolling hills and level ridgetops to some very challenging hills and steep slopes. Always wear a helmet and be careful. A permit is required to ride mountain bikes on the Forest trail systems. These permits may be purchased at any of our offices or from local vendors. Also of note, the Wayne National Forest trails are closed to mountain biking from December 16 through April 14. We hope you enjoy riding the Wayne National Forest! Check out our !
