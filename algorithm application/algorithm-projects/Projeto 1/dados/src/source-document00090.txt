Welcome to Shawn Brown Cartography
On this website you can find examples of my work in the . I create custom maps appropriate for fantasy and sci-fi games in both color and black & white. I’m comfortable making maps in a wide variety of styles at almost any scale—from floor plans to continents to solar systems. Most of my fantasy work has a hand-made or engraved look. portfolio
I accept single-map commissions as well as larger, more involved projects. If you request a historical map, we will need to discuss the level of detail and historical accuracy required to complement your product. Additionally, some research will probably need to be done—you can supply this yourself or I can do it for you.
Although the gallery has no examples of star charts or war game boards, I’m available for such commissions. If necessary, I can create a small sample for your consideration before contracting the job.
If you like what you see on the following pages and need maps for a particular work, you can by email to discuss your project. contact me
