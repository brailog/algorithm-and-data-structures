Description:
I require the design of a logo for a BBQ Ecommerce Shop that I am launching. The design should be based around the words 'BBQ Pro'. It should be a simple, clean but clever design with an industrial feel to it. I was thinking maybe the 'o' of the word 'pro' might be designed so that it looks like the flames of a gas hob being viewed from above. This is just a suggestion, but I am open to any good ideas from As part of the project, as well as a static logo, I would also like an animated logo. Again this should be a simple, clean but clever animate and the finished animation should be an exact replica of the static logo. As part of your quote I would like to see at least 6 examples of previous work you have completed. Thank you.
