Note: Separate PDQ summaries on Screening for Cervical Cancer and Cervical Cancer Treatment are also available. An estimated 13,000 new cervical cancers and 4,100 cervical cancer deaths will occur in the United States in 2002.[] An additional 1,250,000 women will be diagnosed yearly with changes referred to as squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). These changes form a continuum divided into low- or high-grade SIL or CIN 1, 2, and 3 that reflects increasingly abnormal changes of the affected epithelium. These lesions can persist, regress, or progress to an invasive malignancy. High-grade SIL (CIN 2-3) is more likely to persist or progress and less often regresses spontaneously, while low-grade SIL (CIN 1) often regresses without treatment. The average time for progression of CIN 3 to invasive cancer has been estimated to be 10 to 15 years, based on the mean age of diagnosis of these 2 conditions.[] There is a small subset of rapidly progressive cervical cancers which are diagnosed within 3 years of a confirmed negative Pap test. These tumors occur in younger women with higher socioeconomic status as compared to a control cervical cancer group. One third of these cancers are adenocarcinomas of endocervical origin which may not be adequately screened by conventional Pap test methods.[] The Pap test is a screening tool that identifies women likely to have premalignant disease and at high risk for cervical cancer. The widely used Bethesda System of reporting Pap tests was developed in 1988.[] The cytologic terms, low- and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL and HSIL), correlate with the histopathologic diagnoses of CIN 1, and CIN 2-3, respectively. Strengths of this system are that it requires an evaluation of the adequacy of the specimen and encourages a descriptive diagnosis of abnormalities. Abnormalities that do not fulfill the criteria for SIL are termed atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). Persistent atypical smears should be evaluated colposcopically. An estimated 5% to 10% of patients with this cytologic finding will subsequently be shown to have HSIL or rarely, invasive cancer.[-] Strong risk factors for cervical cancer and its precursors have been identified and include: early age at first intercourse (16 years or younger), a history of multiple sexual partners, a history of genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection or other sexually transmitted disease, the presence of other genital tract neoplasia, and prior squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL).[-] Many of these factors appear to be surrogate markers for HPV exposure and infection.[] Additional risk factors include active or passive smoking, a current or past sexual partner with risk factors for sexually transmitted disease, immunodeficiency or HIV positivity, and poor nutrition.[-] It is estimated that more than 6 million women in the United States have persistent HPV infection. The FDA has approved a second generation single test, Hybrid Capture II (HC II), that identifies the presence of carcinogenic HPV that can be generated by HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68. It is expected that this test will eventually be integrated into the clinical management of cervical neoplasia, but optimal use of HPV testing will depend on selecting a balance between test sensitivity and specificity that allows identification of clinically significant cases while avoiding clinical interventions that do not benefit and possibly harm the patient.[] Population-based screening approaches incorporating HPV testing will need to be tailored to the age profile of the population and the prevalence of infection. Several case-control studies have investigated the effects of various micronutrients on risk and have found that high dietary carotene and possibly vitamins C and E and folate are associated with reduced risk for cervical cancer.[-] Epidemiologic studies of patients with SIL and cervical cancer have suggested that low intake of vitamin A is associated with risk.[] Both case-control and prospective studies that have evaluated plasma levels of vitamins demonstrated an inverse correlation between beta-carotene levels and cervical neoplasia.[,-] Folate deficiency may play a role in cervical carcinogenesis, possibly by facilitating incorporation of HPV at a fragile genomic site. However, 2 randomized trials of oral folate as a chemopreventive agent have shown no protective effect. A considerable amount of experimental data suggests that vitamin A and its derivatives inhibit HPV-associated proliferation; several trials using retinoids are now nearing completion. A randomized trial using locally applied beta-trans-retinoic acid demonstrated increased regression of CIN 2, but not CIN 3;[] however, this treatment approach remains experimental. Current standard treatment modalities are extremely effective in eradicating SIL and preventing development of invasive cervical cancer. Date Last Modified: 07/2002

SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE
Abundant evidence suggests that regular gynecologic examinations and Pap tests for all women beginning at the onset of sexual activity, or by approximately age 18 years if not sexually active, decreases cervical cancer incidence and mortality. An upper age limit at which such screening ceases to be effective is not known.

Pap Test 4 5 7
Reliability of the smear depends on the technique employed to obtain the cytologic specimen and the adequacy of its review by the cytologist. Pap test failure rate in diagnosing invasive cancer can be as high as 50% [] emphasizing the need to biopsy any visible lesions of the cervix, even if associated with a normal Pap test. Careful inspection of the cervix and lower genital tract for areas of nodularity and friability should be part of each exam. 8
The accessibility of the cervix to examination provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the disease status and response to intervention. Commonly employed methods of treatment for premalignant lesions include laser vaporization or excision, cryosurgery, cold knife conization, loop electrosurgical excision, or simple hysterectomy. Strategies to combine diagnosis and treatment such as loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) may be appropriate, particularly in women for whom follow-up is not effective.[] Despite the efficacy of excisional treatment of intraepithelial lesions in reducing the risk of developing invasive cervical cancer, the risk of cancer remains elevated above that of the general population and warrants careful follow-up for at least 8 to 10 years.[] The slow progression of preinvasive disease into invasive cancer and the easy access to visual and cytologic investigation makes squamous intraepithelial lesions an ideal disease for chemoprevention clinical trials. Multiple case-control studies support the chemopreventive role of micronutrients. 9 10

Risk Factors 1 5 6 7 9
Epidemiologic studies to evaluate risk factors for the development of SIL and cervical malignancy demonstrate conclusively a sexual mode of transmission of a carcinogen.[] It is now widely accepted that HPV is the primary etiologic infectious agent.[,,] Other sexually transmitted factors, including herpes simplex virus 2, may play a cocausative role.[] The finding of HPV viral DNA integrated in the majority of cellular genomes of invasive cervical carcinomas supports epidemiologic data linking this agent to cervical cancer;[] however, direct causation has not been demonstrated. There are over 80 distinct types of HPV identified, approximately 30 of which infect the human genital tract. HPV types 16 and 18 are most often associated with invasive disease. Characterization of carcinogenic risk associated with HPV types is an important step in the process of developing a combination HPV vaccine for the prevention of cervical neoplasia. In a population-based study of HPV infection and cervical neoplasia in Costa Rica, 80% of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and invasive lesions were associated with HPV infection by 1 or more of 13 cancer-associated types.[] In this study, the risk of about half of HSIL and invasive cervical cancer was attributable to HPV 16. HPV 18 was associated with 15% of invasive disease, but only 5% of HSIL, suggesting that HPV 18 may have a role in more aggressive cases of cervical malignancy. 1 6 10 11 1 12 13
Human Papillomavirus Testing 14
HPV testing has also been proposed as a secondary test following an abnormal, equivocal or low-grade, screening cytology result. The utility of HPV testing for determining triage to colposcopy, in the context of an abnormal cytology, is likely to differ in women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) versus those with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). A study of women with cytologic diagnoses of LSIL demonstrated a high percentage (83%) with positive HPV DNA test results, limiting the triage utility of the assay. Relatively few women would be spared referral to colposcopy based on a negative HPV result, therefore the cost of testing could not be justified.[] HPV testing, however, may be an option for women and their doctors to consider after a screening cytology result of ASCUS. In one study of nearly 1,000 women, HPV testing was shown to be as or more sensitive compared to a single repeat cytology test for the colposcopic detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2-3.[] The program sensitivity of multiple repeat cytology tests, however, has not been evaluated in comparison to HPV testing. 15 16
Users of barrier methods of contraception are associated with a reduced incidence of SIL presumptively secondary to protection from sexually transmitted disease.[,] Spermicides may be a contributing influence, as they have been demonstrated to have an antiviral action.[] Women of grand multiparity are at increased risk for cervical cancer,[] and long-term users of oral contraceptives (5 years or more) have an increased incidence, particularly of adenocarcinoma.[,,] A relative and possibly absolute increase in mortality in adenocarcinoma of the cervix appears to be occurring, especially in younger women.[] 17 18 19 20 1 21 22 23
Cigarette smoking by women is associated with an increased risk for squamous cell carcinoma.[,-] This risk increases with longer duration and intensity of smoking and may be present with exposure to environmental tobacco smoke as well, being as high as 3 times that of women who are nonsmokers and are not exposed to environmental smoking.[] Some studies demonstrate an increased risk for current smokers only as opposed to former smokers, suggesting that carcinogens in cigarette smoke exert a late-stage effect on carcinogenesis.[] 1 24 26 1 25
Older women (age 60 and above) are at increased risk for cervical cancer as they are less willing or able to seek medical care for screening for this disease and participate in treatment. Further, their primary care physician has often changed from the obstetrician/gynecologist to the general practitioner with less emphasis on prevention of cervical cancer.[,] Minorities including African Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanics (but not Asian Americans) have a higher risk than Caucasians. Much of the difference can be explained by socioeconomic factors and associated risk factors.[] 27 28 29
Decreased mortality secondary to cytological screening for cervical abnormalities has been demonstrated in multiple, broad-based population studies.[-] Unscreened or underscreened high-risk groups should be identified and targeted for screening programs.[,] Educational efforts, transportation, efforts to establish a regular health care provider, and screening convenient to the work place have been shown to have a positive impact on women participating in screening.[-] In communities where English is a second language, healthcare providers fluent in the native language can effectively facilitate these efforts.[] Frequently, the high-risk individual is seen at a medical facility for unrelated health issues and is not provided with cytologic screening. Provision of a modality by which hospitals and emergency services could identify and screen these women could potentially further reduce mortality.[,] 30 32 33 34 35 40 41 42 43
Dietary Factors 44 48 49 45 50 53 54
Given the etiologic role of HPV in the pathogenesis of cervical neoplasia, vaccines to immunize against HPV infection would offer a primary prevention strategy for cervical cancer. Vaccines using HPV late protein (L1 and L2) constructs to induce antibody-mediated immunity are in clinical trials.[] 55
