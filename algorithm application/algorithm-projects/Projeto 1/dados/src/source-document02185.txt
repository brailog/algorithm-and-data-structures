The Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center at Massachusetts General Hospital offers comprehensive evaluations and individualized care to children and adults with bleeding disorders due to hemophilia A, hemophilia B, rare clotting factor deficiencies, and von Willebrand disease. We have available specialists in hematology, orthopedics, infectious diseases, in addition to hemophilia nursing and social services.
Comprehensive clinics for severely affected patients are held monthly for children on the eighth floor of the Yawkey Center for Outpatient Care and on the seventh floor for adults. We also evaluate and treat children with platelet-related bleeding disorders: ITP, thrombocytopenias due to other causes, and disorders fo platelet dysfunction. While one of the newer programs in the Boston area, our program is also one of the fastest growing, with the advent of a full-service obstetrics service at Massachusetts General Hospital, the expansion of the network of Partners affiliated pediatricians, and the presence of New England’s premier clinical coagulation laboratory.
We also provide comprehensive care to children, adolescents, and adults with complex inherited or acquired thrombotic disorders, including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura. For children without symptoms whose parents or other close relatives have suffered a major thrombotic event, we offer evaluations of and counseling for inherited risk factors.
In pediatrics, we currently follow thirty children with severe, moderate, and mild hemophilia, approximately one hundred children with von Willebrand disease, and evaluate thirty to forty new patients each year for thrombotic disorders. In medicine, we currently follow thirty adults with severe, moderate, and mild hemophilia, approximately seven hundred adults with von Willebrand disease, and evaluate two hundred to three hundred new patients each year for thrombotic disorders.
