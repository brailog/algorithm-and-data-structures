Exercise is good for your overall health, BUT these activities can raise your risk of injury such as sprained joints and strained muscles. Proper care in the first days after injury can reduce your down time. In the event of an injury treat with :
R.I.C.E.
Rest is important for 2 reasons. The first reason is that you do not want to sustain further injury to that area. The second is because to heal itself your body needs rest.R = REST
Ice bags, cold packs, frozen peas all work well wrapped in a damp thin towel. Cold provides short-term pain relief as well as reducing swelling. Do not ice for more than 15-20 minutes at a time.I = ICE
Compression will limit the swelling which would have slowed down the healing process. Wrap the injured area with an elastic bandage, rewrap more loosely if throbbing occurs.C = COMPRESSION
Elevating the body part reduces swelling.E = ELEVATION
After a day or two of most injuries have begun to heal. If you do not have a decrease in pain or swelling you may need to go to your physician and also request a referral to see a physiotherapist.R.I.C.E.
A physiotherapist is trained and experienced in treating muscles, nerves, joints and ligament complaints. They can assist with reducing pain and swelling, and developing an individualized exercise plan to get you back to your normal daily activities as soon as possible.
