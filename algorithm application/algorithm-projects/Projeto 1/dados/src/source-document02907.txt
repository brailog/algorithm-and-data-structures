The terms of the employment contract includes, for example:
pay;
holidays; and
working conditions.
If you are turned down for a job or a promotion because your disability would make it harder for you to do the job than a person without disabilities, the employer could be guilty of discrimination if:
they could make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to the workplace or working arrangements which would mean you would be able to do the job; and
you are otherwise the best candidate.
For example, if you are turned down for a job because a disability has stopped you getting a driving licence, the employer could be guilty of discrimination if:
the driving licence is not strictly necessary to do the job because the amount of travelling is small and you could do it, for example, by taxi; and
you are otherwise the best candidate for the job.
Other ‘reasonable adjustments’ may be, for example:
providing a different keyboard, phone or lighting;
providing extra training;
giving you a parking space at work;
moving a workstation so you can use it while in a wheelchair; or
changing the working hours to fit in with a care assistant.
What is reasonable depends on the circumstances. For example, it may be reasonable for a large employer to make greater adjustments than a smaller employer.
Employers must not discriminate against disabled people when dismissing staff or making them redundant, unless they can properly justify it. For example, an employer may be able to justify dismissing you or asking you to take early retirement if your disability has got worse to the point where you can no longer do the main part of your job, and there are no other jobs you could do for that employer even if a ‘reasonable adjustment’ is made.If you are dismissed or made redundant
It is unlawful for someone to harass you because of your disability. Harassment is any action that violates your dignity or creates an intimidating or offensive environment for you. If you face harassment at work for a reason related to your disability, this would count as discrimination, because your employer would be responsible for getting the person or people who are harassing you to stop.If you are being harassed
