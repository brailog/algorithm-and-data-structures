Meeting our new neighbors ... California Highway Patrol

You know the saying, "It's a very small world"? Well that was especially true today. We're in the process of finishing up our new office in Orange, CA. Today the cabling guys had to run fiber optic and ethernet cable from the 2nd floor of the building down to the first floor and the street.
It turns out there is a California Highway Patrol facility right under our new office. Here you can see a nice shiny CHP patrol car.
Way way back in 1995, I was a CHP Explorer and the organization gave me a great sense of direction (and kept me out of trouble). Explorers helped out around the office and were able to take "ride-alongs" wth officers. So for an 8-hour shift, we sat in the passenger seat and zoomed around the freeways.
On occassions, we were able to write tickets - well fill out the ticket with the officer watching VERY closely behind us. Of course, the officer signs the ticket and gives it back to the driver.
It's too bad the explorer program has been scaled down (maybe it's completely gone) because it kept many kids out of trouble and dozens of explorers eventually became officers at the CHP and other departments.
Here's another picture from our parking lot.
