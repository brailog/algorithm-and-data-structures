Researching annuities
Once you’ve decided that a particular type of fits into your retirement plans, it’s a good idea to compare similar offerings from several companies and to research the companies themselves. The reason it’s important to evaluate annuity providers — especially if you’re considering a fixed annuity, a fixed account within a variable annuity, annuitization, or an immediate annuity — is that you’re dependent on the company to uphold to its part of the contract. If it has financial problems, your long-term security could be at risk. You can turn to professional rating services for this information. The best known are A.M. Best Company, Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s, Fitch, Inc., and Weiss Research. They evaluate providers and publish their findings regularly, both in print and online. The ratings, expressed as letter grades, range from AAA (also expressed as A++ or Aaa) at the top to F at the bottom — though some firms rate the least viable companies with Cs and Ds. The factors the consider include claims — paying ability, financial reserves, financial history, and the soundness of the company’s investments. Much of the analysis is quantitative, but ratings may also include qualitative assessments of management style, investment style, and other factors. annuity
