Graduate Catalog
These programs are 12-course programs with a comprehensive examination, thesis option or applied research project at the end of all course work.  Objectives and requirements for each degree program are outlined in the section that follows.
 Graduate programs are generally structured in similar fashion. In addition to a required research methodology course, each major consists of core and major courses. Core courses are required and are designed to provide the theoretical underpinning for future work. Major courses allow students to make choices depending on his or her professional and personal goals. Within the major courses, students may have an opportunity to specify a concentration which offers a choice of classes within the academic discipline allowing students to focus on specific areas of interest (e.g., Logistics, Terrorism, World War II, Ancient Warfare, etc.).  Finally, each student rounds out the program with electives, which vary according to the degree program.General Masters Degree Program Structure
