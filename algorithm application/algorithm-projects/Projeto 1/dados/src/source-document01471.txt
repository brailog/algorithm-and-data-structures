The available experimental materials allow the carrying out of all basic experiments in the field of photovoltaics. The materials are arranged clearly and optically attractive in a specific yellow suitcase. Everything is always completely at hand, extra material is not necessary. The experiments can be fast built up and removed. An instruction manual with a large variety of experiments and a separat documentation of the related solutions are included (English language). So this kit is highly suitable for classroom experiments in schools: The pupils are able to carry out the experiments by themselves with help of of the easily understandable experimentation instruction. The teacher gets further informations to solve the exercises and to understand the physics. List of experiments Set of equipment supplied:
