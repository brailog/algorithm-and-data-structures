Preparing for the future
The Galileo satellite radio navigation system proposed by the European Union offers advantages to Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) users by providing additional satellites, additional signals, and compatibility with GPS. Trimble fully supports this advancement in the GNSS market.
As we have done with products that capitalize on next generation GPS capabilities, we are committed to having Galileo compatible products available for our customers well in advance of Galileo system availability. In the case of GPS modernization, our compatible products were available a year ahead of the first L2C-capable satellite launch. Trimble has also developed products for the coming L5 GPS signal.
Likewise, we will offer equipment with Galileo capability well ahead of the time when production satellites are launched. In the meantime, introducing products that take advantage of next generation GPS will continue to be our near-term focus. It is our goal to offer the most productive and competitive equipment that addresses our customers' needs both now and in the future.
