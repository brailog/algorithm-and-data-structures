COEUR D'ALENE - Kootenai Health and Intermax Networks today announced that the hospital has selected Intermax to maintain and enhance their wide area network that connects doctors and medical professionals to the hospital and the internet. This service of Kootenai Health allows doctors secure access to patient records and images and very fast internet connections from their offices or homes.
The Kootenai Health wireless network has been installed and running for several years. With the increasing need for internet bandwidth and opportunities for doctors to provide more timely and convenient patient services, hospital management decided to find a local partner with expertise in private microwave networks to partner on the project.
"Kootenai Health has been a pioneer in medical technology for a long time," said Mike Kennedy, President of Intermax Networks. "The service they provide to the community, and their medical professionals, is exceptional and we are pleased to be a part of improving and enhancing their microwave network."
"Intermax gives us many options for service and support and their network technical expertise is exceptional", said Tom Legel, Vice President and CFO of Kootenai Health. The partnership between the companies also will allow the hospital to expand service to doctors whose offices and homes may not have had the opportunity to get service before.
"We look forward to a long and prosperous relationship with Kootenai Health, assisting them in their mission of a healthier community," stated Kennedy.
