Buzz! Junior: RoboJam
Cheeky fun has returned in robot form for Buzz! Junior loving boys and girls (and a few mums and dads too).
Buzz! Junior: RoboJam features four cute robots competing in a number of ridiculous and funny challenges to become Robot of the Month. You'll need quick reactions in order to help them battle their way through a hilarious collection of great new games. These include dodging the rockets of top military droids on the firing range, becoming crash test dummies for the day, and dancing the night away with an enormous singing alien octopus. The hapless robot pals compete against each other in an every-bot-for-himself competition. Gain the greatest number of nuts for your robot by the end of the challenge to win! When less than four players are available, or even when only one person is playing, Buzz! Junior: RoboJam, allows players to participate in the full 4-player mode and have the most possible fun.
