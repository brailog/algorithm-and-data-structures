Preparing your taxes online is quick and easy with H&R Block’s do-it-yourself program. Just follow these simple steps:
1. Set up your account
Set up your account with a member ID and a password of your choice. Make sure your password is easy to remember!
Once your account is set up, come back as often as you’d like to complete, review or change your tax return.
2. Input your tax information
Screens will prompt you to enter your information step by step. By answering a few simple questions, you customize your return to fit your personal tax situation.
Don't worry about the calculations - the program does them for you!
Similarly, there's no need to worry about which forms and worksheets to use. The program will select any that you'll need.
3. Conduct a Final Review
Go over your tax return one last time with the Final Review.
The online tax program will point out any deductions you may have missed.
Making changes at this stage is still simple.
4. File your return
Once your return is complete, file electronically using NETFILE and/or NetFile Quebec (if available). Or, if you'd prefer, simply print out your return and mail it.
The cost of preparing your return with our online program is only $19.95 for each individual return.
