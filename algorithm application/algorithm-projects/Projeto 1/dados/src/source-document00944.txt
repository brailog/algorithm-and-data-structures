Rustan Group
· How would you describe the luxury sector in the Philippines and its clients?
Based on the last census, the Philippine population is approximately 76,500,000 or 15,300,000 households. Those who belong to the upper income segments account for 1% to 3% of the total population. Most of these households are concentrated in Metro Manila. The Rustan Group has been serving the most affluent segments of Philippine society for over 50 years. Our Company has unmatched, in-depth understanding of this market.
Among local players we enjoy the highest market shares for the various luxury goods across product categories. Rustan's is best positioned to capture luxury spending in the country as we have the brand image, equity, patronage, and availability of desired brands of the target population. While small in numbers the clientele for luxury goods enjoys very high purchasing power, and has a high propensity to travel and buy luxury goods abroad-in Europe, Asia, and the U.S. Thus, competition for the Rustan Group is global and not local. As incomes among the middle and upper middle income groups increase, we also expect an increase in the market demand for luxury goods in the country.
· Elaborate on the way you identify needs (clients feedback, other countries' ideas) and how you operate to fulfill them.
We conduct regular quantitative and qualitative studies in order to identify needs, satisfaction levels, patronage, and buying habits of the market-at-large and our customers. However, research can only tell you what is, not necessarily what can be. Thus, we also look at best practices and innovations abroad to ensure that we are at least at par with global standards. Furthermore, we use what we have learned from our counterparts abroad to continuously define the standards for quality and efficiency among retailers in the country. We select what we feel will work and adapt concepts and ideas to the local context in order to continuously be at the forefront of innovation in the country.
· How and when did you realize you could not only focus on the top segment of the market and how have you diversified your products and clientele since then? Furthermore, could you give a short explanation on the expansion of the Rustans group?
While Rustan's enjoys an almost unassailable position in the high-end segment of retailing in the Philippines, the mother lode of retail demand is in the middle to lower-middle income groups. Rustan's has always been one of the top retailers in the country, and we would not want to be relegated to being a niche player. Thus, we have expanded our business to include new formats and tap new markets that we previously did not reach, such as the middle income groups.
Our first major foray into the discount retailing segment was undertaken in 1998 through our Shopwise Hypermarkets. Since the introduction of Shopwise nine years ago, it has already grown to be the top sales contributor and the fastest growing company within the Rustan Group. We also have supermarkets and convenience stores that allow us to expand to more diverse geographical areas.
· How were the subsidiaries of Rustans created and how have they evolved? (Shopwise, Starbucks.)
Rustan's decision to diversify into hypermarkets was borne out of manifest opportunities brought about by fundamental changes that were taking place in the market: the burgeoning middle class, increasing value consciousness across various income levels, new geographical market opportunities that are best served through discount retailing operations, and the limited growth opportunities in the "upper crust" segment. We developed the first hypermarket operations in the country. Since then Shopwise has gone on to win various awards, including the "Best Retailer of the Year" in the hypermarket given by the Philippine Retailers Association.
As the premier luxury retailer in the country, Rustan's was in a unique position to expand and diversify the luxury market through the growing global trend of brand franchising. In 1988, after clearly seeing and thoroughly studying this business phenomenon, the Rustan Group of Companies established Stores Specialists, Inc. (SSI) to acquire, manage and develop exclusive franchises of the world's most prestigious brands.
Previously available only through department stores, SSI pioneered the explosion of luxury retailing in the Philippines by launching stylish boutique stores for each label. This principle allowed designer brands like Prada, Lacoste, and Zara to establish their own unique image, offer a wider range of merchandise, and target consumers more effectively. Today, SSI is the top brand management company in the Philippines and one of the largest in the Asia-Pacific region, with over 45 international franchises and hundreds of boutiques in almost every major retail center in the country.
In 1997, Rustan's Coffee Corporation was granted a licensing agreement to exclusively develop the internationally popular Starbucks specialty coffee outlets in the Philippines. With its pioneering initiatives and desire to bring the best to the Philippines, Rustan's successfully acquired exclusive franchising during a time when the Philippine market was not a priority for Starbucks International operations. Rustan's Coffee Corporation is one of our most profitable subsidiaries.
The introduction of Starbucks to the Philippine market successfully created a new coffee lifestyle among Filipino consumers, and gave birth to a thriving specialty coffee industry which did not exist before.
· On a final note, could you please elaborate on the Foundation that gives support to the arts, and other CSR programs to be carried out this year?
The Tantoco-Rustia Foundation was established in 1995 as the philanthropic arm of the Rustan Group of Companies, with a particular emphasis on supporting causes that uplift Filipino culture and art. Since its establishment, the Foundation has staged or supported numerous causes, like the much-anticipated annual Red Cross Ball, which raises funds to benefit programs of the Philippine Red Cross; and the yearly concerts in cooperation with the Philippine-Italian Association, with proceeds to benefit the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra Instruments Fund, an initiative that raises much-needed funds for the replacement and rehabilitation of dilapidated musical instruments of the country's premier orchestra.
