Silicoflex
Expansion Joints
is a pre-formed silicone joint that is bonded to concrete, elastomeric concrete, polymer concrete and steel joint interfaces.  It is a long term solution to the ever present problem of sealing deck joints on bridges, parking structures, railroad bridges and other structures experiencing thermal displacements. Silicoflex
is used primarily as an expansion joint edge material, a flexible nosing material for metallic expansion joint assemblies, and a patching compound for spalls in concrete deck surfaces. Tronflex Elastomeric Concrete
is a two component, self leveling, fast curing, urethane sealant for use in deck joint sealing. UraTron Sealant
are available in Aluminum Saw-Tooth design 110 and 160 mm movement capabilities and in Steel Finger Joint design from 100 to 500 mm capacities in 50 mm increments or to custom requirements. ETIC Expansion Joints
