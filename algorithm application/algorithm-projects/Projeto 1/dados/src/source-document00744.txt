Las Vegas Wedding - Red Rock
About 65 million years ago a strong earthquake rumbled under the southern Nevada desert, and two of the earth's plates collided with such force that part of one plate was shoved up over much younger sandstone formations. The result is the Keystone Thrust Fault, part of which is seen at Red Rock Canyon, a spectacular piece of geology, 17 miles west of Las Vegas.A modern visitor center overlooks the recreation area with information on the geology and wildlife of the preserve. Red Rock Canyon covers nearly 200,000 acres of multicolored sandstone and limestone, canyons and mountains, washes and waterfalls, and a variety of desert flora and fauna. The entire Red Rock area is laced with hiking trails for those who feel most energetic.
Las Vegas Wedding - Lake Las Vegas Wedding
For a special memory to last a lifetime, we've chosen one of Las Vegas' newest and most exclusive resorts and combined it with an incredible wedding or renewal of vows and yacht reception. Welcome to Lake Las Vegas! Two limousines will transport you and up to 14 guests to the Lake Las Vegas Resort, which offers a beautiful backdrop of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, the Hyatt Regency Hotel, MonteLago Village, multi-million dollar homes, and several golf courses, all surrounding ten miles of beautiful shoreline. Your wedding can be held at one of three venues: the "Lady of the Lake," a 60-foot private luxury yacht; the Beach of Mira Lago at Reflection Bay; or the beautiful Garden area at Reflection Bay. After preparing for the wedding in the bride's room aboard the "Lady of the Lake," the bride and her attendants can make a grand arrival by yacht for the beach or garden wedding. Once the ceremony is complete, the wedding party and guests can board the yacht for the reception. Aboard the "Lady of the Lake," white-gloved waiters will be serving Champagne, Wedding Cake, and a full six-selection hors d'oeuvres reception. Flowers include a Large Cascade Bouquet, Three-rose Romantic Posey, and two boutonnieres. Select from either Fresh or Silk flowers, Rose color, and Ribbon color. A Photographer will accompany you to your ceremony and reception. You will receive 36-4x6 photos.
The "Lady of the Lake" has a maximum occupancy of 30 people. Please let us know if you need additional accommodations for extra guests.
