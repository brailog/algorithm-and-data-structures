From Louie to Dizzy to Chet to Miles, and now Wynton and Roy Hargrove, the trumpet has always been one the most popular lead instruments in jazz. Though it does show up in rock, funk and reggae horn sections, and even has a few classical pieces written for it as the lead instrument, our most vivid image of the trumpet is that of a darkened club with wisps of smoke floating around a well-dressed horn player.
