WALL-E
Â 
One of the most popular movies of the year inspired one of the best PS2 games, telling the story of the little robot that everyone forgot to turn off. Not only does it capture the look and charm of the movie and its adorable protagonist, each stage features a different style of gameplay, keeping the fun flowing from start to finish. Released: October 2008 Following the success of LEGO Star Wars and LEGO Indiana Jones, the Caped Crusader received the construction block treatment in 2008. A horde of familiar super villains has escaped from Arkham Asylum, leaving Batman and Robin to clean up Gotham City. This game is excellent in co-operative mode, where two friends can control any combination of hero and villain. Released: November 2008 The Guitar Hero phenomenon got bigger in 2008, as the new instruments included with Guitar Hero World Tour allowed aspiring drummers, bass players and singers to get in on the action. The result is one of the best social games available; it's a wonderful feeling to have a group of friends all in synch and rocking out to one of the many tracks included on the DVD. Released: November 2008 Anyone with a voice can play SingStar and everyone will want to with this game, thanks to the universal appeal of Disney movies and their iconic music. SingStar Singalong with Disney features 20 songs from such classics as The Lion King, Cinderella and The Jungle Book, along with videos featuring all of your favourite characters. Released: November 2008 One of the most original games released in 2008, EyeToy Play: Hero makes innovative use of the EyeToy USB Camera to put you in the shoes of a medieval hero trying to defeat a mischievous warlord. Included with the game is a green toy sword which, thanks to some clever technology, appears on screen when held on front of the EyeToy USB Camera. Any movement you make is detected, putting you directly into the game as you swing and slash your way through varied environments. The bright, colourful graphics make for a title that young children will love and adults will be amazed by. These are just five of the great PS2 games released in 2008, also worth checking out are: EyeToy Play: PomPom Party, Buzz! Junior: Ace Racers, Yakuza 2, SingStar Boybands vs Girlbands, Dancing Stage SuperNOVA 2, Alone in the Dark, Luxor: Pharaoh's Challenge and Sega Superstars Tennis.
