Two most important things to do:
Go to the lowest floor possible
Put as many walls as possible between you and the tornado
If a tornado threatens and you are:
In a house or small building:
Go to the basement. If there is no basement, go to an interior room on the lowest floor
Take cover under something sturdy like a staircase or workbench
Cover yourself with a blanket, pillows or cushions to soften effects of flying glass and debris
Stay away from windows and outside walls
In a mobile home or automobile:
Get out. Neither is a shelter against a tornado
Seek shelter in a permanent, sturdy structure
If no shelter is available, lie in a ditch or low-lying area away from mobile homes and vehicles
Lie flat and protect your head with your hands
In a shopping center, school building or factory:
Go to a pre-designated shelter area if available
Avoid buildings with large-span roofs
Find an interior room, closet, bathroom or hallway
Crouch down and cover your head with your hands
Stay away from windows
Terms you should know
