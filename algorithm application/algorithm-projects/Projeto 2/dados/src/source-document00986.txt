A set of tools to assist planetary scientists in the planning, acquisition and interpretation of observations of the ringed (and possibly-ringed) planets.
Rings Node On-line Tools
Versions of these tools are now available to support the and the Jupiter flyby. Cassini Mission New Horizons
These forms enable you to generate a diagram showing the appearance of a planetary system at a specified time. Bodies and rings are rendered with terminators and shadows as appropriate. The viewpoint can be Earth's center, a particular Earth-based observatory, or a spacecraft.
Planet Viewers
These forms enable you to generate a diagram showing the apparent east-west motion of one or moons relative to the disk of a planet, within a specified time period.
Moon Trackers
Click for , , , , or . Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Mars
These forms enable you to generate a table listing useful information about the viewing geometry for a planet and/or any of its moons as a function of time. You are free to specify which of a variety of useful quantities to tabulate (e.g. RA and dec, phase angle, ring opening angle, distance, lunar phase, etc.).
Ephemeris Generators
Cassini Tools
These versions of the tools are intended to assist in the planning and analysis of Cassini data.
Saturn tools are updated regularly with the reconstructed Cassini tour.
