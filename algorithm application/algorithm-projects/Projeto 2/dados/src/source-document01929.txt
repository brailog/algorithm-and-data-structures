While there are numerous National Cemeteries in Virginia, only three remain open for burial. 
These are: 
Quantico National Cemetery 
 Culpeper National Cemetery
is the only national cemetery administered by the Department of the Army. Arlington is the final resting place of presidents, Supreme Court justices, astronauts, Medal of Honor recipients and other notable Americans and is, perhaps, best known for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Arlington National Cemetery has strict eligibility requirements. Nelsen Funeral Home & Crematory personnel will assist you in determining eligibility.  Arlington National Cemetery
is located midway between Fredericksburg and Washington, DC., on land that was part of the U.S. Marine Corps Base. Quantico has hosted military operations for over 200 years, first used by Virginia for naval operations in 1775, and later as a blockade point for the Confederate army. In 1977, the Marine Corps donated this land to the National Cemetery Administration. The cemetery was dedicated on May 15, 1983.  Quantico National Cemetery
is located approximately 35 miles west of Fredericksburg. The Culpeper area was the site of many Civil War battles. Following the war, a reburial program was initiated by the federal government to locate the remains of all Union soldiers and reinter them in national cemeteries. As a result of the number of scattered Union dead in the vicinity, Culpeper National Cemetery was established in 1867. In 1996, Culpeper National Cemetery was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Culpeper National Cemetery
