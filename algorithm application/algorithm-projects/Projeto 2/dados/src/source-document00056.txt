 
How to Prepare for an Appraisal
There are several factors that can affect the appraised value of your home, including whether or not:
It is well maintained inside and out
It is located in a good school district
Additions fit well into the existing house
Properties throughout the neighborhood are well maintained
It is the largest house on the block (or the most improved)
The style of the house conforms with those in the neighborhood
Zoning changes are expected
For those items listed above that you can improve on, such as maintaining your house (which includes repairing leaky faucets, painting over spots on the wall, etc.), it is well worth the effort to do so prior to scheduling the appraisal.
Once you decide to schedule the appraisal, you should try to gather all of the following documents to present to your appraiser upon his or her arrival:
A plot plan or survey of the house and land
Your most recent tax bill or a legal description of the property
Copies of any recent home inspection reports, or other recent reports, such as for termites
A copy of your title policy
Homeowners Association information and fees
Property purchase information for the last three years
All written property agreements that you may have – such as shared driveway maintenance agreement, etc.
A list of personal property that is to be included in the sell of the home
A list of major home improvements (including date and permit confirmation, if necessary)
A copy of the current listing agreement
A copy of the broker’s data sheet
A copy of the Purchase Agreement if a sale is pending
Also prior to the scheduled appraisal, you should also make sure that all areas of your home are accessible and that your home is as clean and orderly as possible to make a good impression on the appraiser.
Once your appraiser has arrived, you do not need to accompany him or her along on the entire site inspection, but you should be available to answer questions about your property and be willing to point out any home improvements.
The Appraisal Process
An appraiser's duty is to inspect the property being appraised to ascertain the true status of that property. Toward this end, an appraiser will analyze market data, including both historic and current comparable sales, current offers, pending sales and proposed improvements to arrive at an appraised value for your home.
