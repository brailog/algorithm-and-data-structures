Corporate Meetings
Sound Vision Audio Visual can help you plan and execute your next meeting, and we have the abilities to offer one stop shopping for our clients.
Should it be interaction with the property that you have your function at, interaction with other vendors, the equipment needed to present your event, or the ability to provide content for your event, Sound Vision can bring all the details together for you.
We have the knowledge that allows us to understand and find solutions for the facilities and technical issues that arise in every function. We use technology to help us find solutions for many of the meeting issues we work with on a daily basis, and we do this because we enjoy the work we do and are always looking for ways to improve.
Here are some of the services we have recently provided our clients with:
General Sessions with presenter on mutiple screens. Presenter being Videoconferenced into the General Session due to scheduling conflicts. Multi break-out rooms with days of intense meetings, new presenter every 10 minutes. Used wireless PowerPoint system designed by Sound Vision. Live webstream out to those that couldn't make it.
Live recording, so that the video of the event can be shown on demand, within an hour after the meeting ends. Provided the Sound and Lights for a band at dinner.
Organized a complete Awards Ceremony to go along with the Annual Dinner, including a highlights video of the meeting, after the Annual Meeting.
Contact us with the details of your next meeting and we'd be happy to work together with you to make your meeting special.
The most important information for us is the date, time and location of function, amount of people, type of content and overall objective of meeting.
