provides you with honest and up-to-date information on the dogs in our care.Adopting a dog from PUP
 
There are no guarantees that you and your dog will be a good fit, but we strive to match our dog's needs and his or her personality, as we've observed it, with the adopter needs in a small dog. Making the best match possible is our mission as we believe the right home will help ensure happy ownership.
 
nbsp;Can I adopt a dog from PUP if I am not a local resident?
Currently we adopt anywhere within the state of Washington.
  Is the dog I'm interested in still available?
All dogs are available unless it states "Adopted" beside their name on the Petfinder page. nbsp;
 How can I get further information and when can I meet the dog?
This is accomplished by first filling out an adoption application. We process them in the order received. From the pool of those that are approved, we match home situations with the dog's individual needs. If your application seems to be a good match, you will receive a call or an email. At that time you will be able to get more information and possibly set up an appointment to meet the dog. nbsp;
 Where are your dogs?
We have no central shelter. Our dogs are all in various foster homes around the greater Seattle area.
 
nbsp; What are youradoption fees?
Our adoption fees range from $100.00 to $400.00.
 
nbsp;   Adoption fees are nonrefundable.  Will my money be returned to me if I adopt a dog and it doesn't work out?
