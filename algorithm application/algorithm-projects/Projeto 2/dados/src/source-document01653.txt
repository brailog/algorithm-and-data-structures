Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) is a system of employment practices under which individuals are not excluded from any participation, advancement or benefits due to race, color, religion, sex or national origin or any other action which cannot lawfully be the basis for employment actions. EEO practices include:
Treating all applicants consistently throughout the selection process
Treating all employees equally in the workplace
Eliminating discriminatory conditions
