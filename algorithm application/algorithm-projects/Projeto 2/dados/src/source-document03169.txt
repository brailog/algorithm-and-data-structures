Product placement in films now games.
August 11th, 2005
Are you paying attention? If you are you can't help but notice all the products being place in Sci-Fi movies like i,robot and The Island. I not only got a vision of the future but also had this uncontrollable urge to buy a pair of Pumas. Reminds me of the Blade Runner days when we knew Atari was forever. Films are one thing, but I see now products are being place in games. I love being moved by films, inspired to compete by games, but now I also have to leave my credit cards locked up at home. Well there is still popcorn and discussing at Starbucks.

Some of you already heard about top pro league PC game players making 6 digit salary in South Korea and some of you may heard of 24 hr Go channel in Korean cable TV. Have you heard of 24 hr game tournament channel then? When I was traveling Korea this May, as I was going through TV channels (as I'm always more interested in what other channels are playing), I stumbled on 24 hour Game channel where dual tournament was being broadcasted live. They were playing Star Craft while 2 commentators talking in the background. The TV screen shows the screen of both players' game screens and the shot of game players who were deeply focused in game to win. Followings are interesting sites: , where you can download VOD archived games and where you can see the list of Official Games such as 'Counter Strike': 'Source', 'FIFA Soccer 2005', 'Need for Speed', 'StarCraft': 'Brood War', 'WarCraft III': 'The Frozen Throne and Warhammer 40,000' : 'Dawn of War'. (sorry about Korean!)
