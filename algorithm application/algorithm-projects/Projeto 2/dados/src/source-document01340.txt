Women's Health
Breast & Cervical Cancer
The Mississippi Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program strives for early detection of cancer in those women at highest risk.
Typically, these are the uninsured, the medically underserved, minority, and elderly women. These women are more likely to have advanced disease when symptoms appear, reflecting differences in access to screening and care.
With federal and matching funds, MSDH/BCCP offers Pap exam screening services at health department clinics, Community Health Centers and private providers to uninsured women between the ages of 40 and 64. Mammography screening is available through contracted providers to uninsured women between 50 and 64 years of age and older. Women 40 to 49 are eligible for screening mammograms when special funding is available. Special exceptions are available for those women between the ages of 18 and 39, but they must receive prior approval. .Please contact us to determine if the patient qualifies
