Please join us in celebrating the Year of the Ox at our annual Lantern Festival from Monday, February 9 through next Thursday, February 12.  On these four nights, in addition to our regular menu, we will offer a special 4-course menu featuring a grass-fed Jersey steer from Chapel Hill Creamery.  More details soon! What is the Lantern Festival? In China, the Lantern Festival begins on the eve of the first full moon of the New Year and is celebrated with competitive pageantry: elaborate lantern displays, yangge dancing, Buddha worship, and ceremonial riddle solving. In Chapel Hill, we mark the occasion every year with tacky paper lanterns and a menu of dishes never before seen at Lantern featuring local ingredients.
