*Abnormally rapid heartbeat and rapid breathing
*Muscle weakness
Depending on the seriousness of the situation, these are the steps an owner should take if his/her dog is suffering from heat exhaustion: 1) Move the dog out of the sun and into the shade or into an air-conditioned building or follow the instructions for shading the dog, as directed above in "Heat Stroke." 2) Give the dog water to drink, but do NOT allow the dog to drink copious amounts. 3) Rinse the dog off with cool water, either in the bath tub or with a garden hose. 4) Place the dog in front of a fan while still damp. 5) Place ice bags around the dog's head and neck. You may also apply them to the groin area for rapid blood cooling. 6) Take the dog to the veterinarian only after the dog has been cooled down. Take your dog's temperature; this should be done rectally to get the most accurate reading. 7) Prepare your dog for transport to the nearest emergency animal clinic. Do NOT cover your dog, even with a cold towel. A towel will prevent the heat from escaping. A cold washcloth on the tummy is fine.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:   *Walk your dog in the early morning or evening when it is cooler.   *Provide constant access to fresh water.   *If possible, keep your dog indoors in a cool, well ventilated or air-conditioned part of the house.   *Air conditioning is one of the best ways to keep a dog cool, but is not always dependable. To provide a cooler environment, freeze water in soda bottles, then wrap them in a towel or tube sock. Place them on the floor for the dog to lie on. You may also place ice and a small amount of water in several resealable food storage bags, cover them with a towel, and place them on the floor for your dog to lie on.   *If you do not have air-conditioning, place a wet towel on the floor, (or use ice bags as explained above), or purchase a cooling pad for your dog to lie on.   *You may want to invest in a "Cooling Jacket" for your pet to wear in hot weather or in unavoidable situations where your dog must be in hot temperatures.  If your pet is outside during the day, consider investing in a Cooler Mat or a Cooling Bandana (they can be purchased from "Drs. Foster and Smith" or many pet supply sources).   *Do not leave your dog in the car, muzzle or confine him/her without shade or confine him/her to concrete or asphalt surfaces.   *If your dog lives outside, make sure s/he has plenty of fresh, water, and that his/her house or bed is in the shade. For an outside dog, an automatic dog waterer is a good way to provide clean fresh water.   *If your dog must be outside on a leash or cable, be sure it is long enough for your pup to reach full shade and that there is nothing for the leash or cable to become entangled in. You do not want to prevent your pup from reaching his/her shade and water!   *After walks, or when your dog seems warm, wipe down the fur with a washcloth or towel rinsed in lukewarm water. Wring the cloth out just enough to keep it from dripping, and soak down the fur of the head, inside the ears, above and under the neck, on the tummy and groin, and on the tops and bottoms of the feet.   *Keep pets with breathing problems indoors.   *Wetting down your dog with cool water or allowing him/her to swim can also help maintain a normal body temperature.HOW TO CARE FOR YOUR DOG IN HOT WEATHER
*Avoid taking your dog in the car with you. If you are accustomed to letting your dog accompany you in the car, do not feel guilty about leaving your pet behind on hot summer days. Your dog will be much happier and safer at home with shade and plenty of fresh cool water. No one should EVER leave a pet in a vehicle - no matter how briefly they intend to be away. Temperatures inside a parked car can rapidly reach dangerous levels, even on relatively mild days, and even if the car is parked in the shade with the windows slightly open. Dark-colored cars especially can become very hot inside - even on days that do not seem too hot to take your dog along. In just minutes, the temperature inside a parked car can climb to well over 120 degrees or more. Even a short time in a hot environment can be life-threatening.
: Dogs with moderate heat stroke often recover without complicating health problems. Severe heat stroke can cause organ damage that may need ongoing care such as a special diet prescribed by your veterinarian. Dogs who suffer from heat stroke once increase their risk of getting it again and steps must be taken to prevent it on hot, humid days.AFTERCARE
