 
“Be Mine,” a curated group exhibition of love poems and photographs opens at the Alliance Gallery in Narrowsburg on Saturday, January 31, 2009 with a reception from 2 - 4 p.m. The exhibit will be on view through Valentine’s Day, February 14. The exhibition “Be Mine” explores the theme of love, as well as creative interpretations of Valentine’s Day. The group exhibition will be comprised of 14 poets and 14 photographers, each with their own vision of romance, beauty, friends, family, cupid, and love. Writer Mary Greene will curate the poetry, while photographs will be curated by gallery director Rocky Pinciotti. ”This exhibition will be distinctive in that we are bringing writers into the gallery as conceptual artists. Their poems will be presented as installations and sculptural objects,” says Pinciotti. “On another level, the photographers will explore the concept of love with their own visual vocabulary.” “It’s exciting to be a part of this new exhibit venture,” says Greene. “All of us need a little brightness and a little extra love in February. And, it’s gratifying to see poets involved in a gallery exhibit.” This exhibit, free and open to the public, is sponsored by the Delaware Valley Arts Alliance, the Arts Council for Sullivan County, NY, and is made possible in part with funding from the Visual Arts Program of the New York State Council on the Arts. Alliance Gallery is located at the Delaware Arts Center at 37 Main Street, Narrowsburg, NY. Hours are Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. For more information about the exhibit call 845-252-7576. The Delaware Arts Center has two exhibition spaces where the public can view and purchase the work of contemporary ertists: Alliance Gallery and LOFT Gallery. Each exhibit has an opening reception where the artist and the arts lover can connect. Email: Rocky@artsalliancesite.org
