Hello everyone.

I have got a hospital appointment through finally for the 19/02/09 to go see the specialist that I was being transferred to, so on that date I will be vacant and at the hospital getting fully checked over.
Now for the interesting news, go over to check the Monthly Updates and Blog as I have updated them with new information ^_^
