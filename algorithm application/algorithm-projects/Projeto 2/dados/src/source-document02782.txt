Chlorpyrifos Home
Major Uses and Biology
Chlorpyrifos displays insecticidal activity against a wide range of insect and arthropod pests. Contact toxicity was demonstrated against representative insect orders such as:
Orthoptera
Hymenoptera
Hemiptera
In addition chlorpyrifos possesses ingestion or stomach activity towards Orthoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera. Direct aqueous exposure to chlorpyrifos has also been shown to be an effective means of controlling certain aquatic insect and crustaceans pests. Toxicity through vapor action was demonstrated against Diptera, Homoptera and Isoptera. Activity of chlorpyrifos towards insect exposed via treated soil has also been well demonstrated.
Chlorpyrifos-ethyl and methyl insecticides are both available to be formulated into many different commercial products for use in pest control operations in the Pacific Area. The most commonly used formulations include the emulsifiable concentrate (EC), granule (GR), wettable powder (WP) and water dispersible granule (WDG). Each formulation is designed as a delivery vehicle for a given pest control scenario to maximize product stability and availability to the target pest and to minimize human exposure. The various formulations are often tailored for a specific use pattern.Chlorpyrifos Formulations
Because of its versatility, chlorpyrifos products are used in a wide range of pest control applications in the Pacific Area (Table 1). From rice in Thailand for control of leafrollers to control of on cotton in Australia, chlorpyrifos- based products have been successfully employed to combat insect and arthropod pests threatening production of food and fiber and to protect human health.Heliothis
