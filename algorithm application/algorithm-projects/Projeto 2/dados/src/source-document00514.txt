Research Interests
Chasteen has always sought to understand and interpret, above all, the of the past. This historical enterprise has so far included studies of everything from armed insurgency to social dance, and it has lingered in many different parts of Latin America, especially Brazil, the R o de la Plata, and more recently, the Andes. In his research, Chasteen always asks "what it was like to be there," and in his writing he uses various narrative strategies to communicate the answer. Language and literature figure importantly in his life and in his work, as does a commitment to Latin American studies beyond a single country of interest. As a graduate teacher, he likes topics off the beaten path (which is where he finds his own), he is more the coach than the authority, and he pays special attention to writing technique. His current projects involve the Independence period, 1800-1825. A representative sample of his work would include: "Violence for Show: Knife Dueling on a Nineteenth-Century Cattle Frontier" (1990), "Fighting Words: The Discourse of Insurgency in Latin American History" (1993), (1995), "The Prehistory of Samba: Carnival Dancing in Rio de Janeiro, 1840-1917" (1996), (2001), (2003), and (forthcoming), as well as a number of major translation and editing projects, including a documents reader on the Independence Period, currently in progress.experienceHeroes on Horseback: A Life and Times of the Last Gaucho CaudillosBorn in Blood and Fire: A Concise History of Latin AmericaNational Rhythms, African Roots: The Deep History of Latin American Popular DanceAmericanos: Latin American Struggles for Independence
