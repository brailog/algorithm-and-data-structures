Teaching about the Caddo
They were a powerful and populous people linked by language, kinship, and beliefs, but divided into several dozen named groups, each having its own history, territory, and traditions. Collectively, the Caddo-speaking peoples formed a society that early Spanish explorers highly regarded as civilized and friendly in comparison to many of their neighbors. Sadly, this initial respect did not spare the Caddo from the common fate of so many of the native societies who came into contact with European diseases, guns, and desires. In less than two centuries, the mighty Caddo were reduced to a few hundred refugees who were assigned tiny parcels of land in the Oklahoma Indian Territories, almost 200 miles west of their homeland.Four hundred years ago the valleys and tributaries of the Ouachita, Red, Sabine, and Neches rivers in what is today northeast Texas, northwest Louisiana, southwest Arkansas, and southeast Oklahoma were home to an extraordinary society of farmers, warriors, potters, priests, and traders, the ancestors of the people known today as the .Caddo
Against all odds, the Caddo survived their nineteenth-century low point and today number over 4000. The members of the don't live on a reservation and many of them don't even live in Oklahoma; they live in houses and apartments in America's cities and rural areas. They are police officers, nurses, lawyers, electricians, artists and more, ordinary Americans with a fascinating heritage stretching back untold thousands of years and far beyond living memory into the ancestral realm of song, ash, and relic. Like many Americans, Caddo peoples strive to maintain and rekindle their cultural traditions amid the harried pace and dizzying changes of modern life. And they wish that more people understood their tribe's proud history and many accomplishments.Caddo Nation of Oklahoma
is the Spanish spelling of a Caddo word , which means "friend" or "ally". In the 17th century the Spanish knew the westernmost Caddo peoples as "the great kingdom of Tejas" and the name lived on to become the name of the 28th state of the United States.TejastayshaTexas
These interwoven exhibits on the theme provide an intimate look at the Caddo's long and distinguished history, at ancient and living Caddo tradition, and at the tribe's many contributions to the cultural heritage of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. The Tejas exhibits explain who the Caddo are, who they were, where they came from, and what Caddo life was like in different points in time. Archival and modern photographs, artwork, documents, maps, and sound clips augment the written discussions.Tejas: the Life and Times of the Caddo Indians
