Huizinga's concept of a 'magic circle' has been used to depictcomputer games and gaming activities as somethingseparate from ordinary life. In this view, games are special (magical) and they only come to life withintemporal and spatial borders that are enactedand performed by the participants. This article discusses the concept of a 'magic circle' and finds that itlacks specificity. Attempts to use the conceptof a magic circle create a number of anomalies that are problematic.This is not, as has been suggested earlier,primarily a matter of the genre of the game, or a discussion of what an appropriate definition of a 'game'might be. Rather, in this study with hardcoregamers, playing computer games is a routine and mundane activity, making the boundary between play and non-playtenuous to say the least. This article presentsan alternative theoretical framework which should be explored further.
