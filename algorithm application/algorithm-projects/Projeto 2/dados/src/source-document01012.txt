INSIDE URANUSUranus is a frozen, gaseous planet. : The planet is shrouded in an icy cloud layer (made up of frozen methane, ethane, and acetylene) circling this planet at 185 mph (300 kph. Uranus' icy atmosphere consist of 83% ,15% , and 2% . The outer layers of the atmosphere are the coldest; temperature and pressure rise under the cloud layer. : Beneath the atmosphere, there is a liquid layer of hydrogen and helium. As depth increases, this layer becomes more viscous, and then partly solid. This layer may be composed of compressed water with ammonia and methane. : Uranus has a molten rocky core about 10,500 miles (17,000 km) in diameter and about 12,500°F (6927°C). This core may have a mass five times greater than the mass of the .
