This live album was recorded during the Music In Head/Friends & Relatives tour of 2000. It struck me immediately upon release of this album that 5 of Neil's most current albums including this one had been live or compilation collections. Hmm, I don't know what to make of that, but it says something.
Anyway, I have fond memories of this tour. This was the very first tour opener I ever attended, and as a result I was present, along with lots of other Rusties, at the first live performance of the song Words (though Neil had somewhat ruined the surprise with his webcast of tour rehearsals that included this song.) The album is not representative of the setlist of most of the tour, but it does have some very nice performances. Words, Cowgirl In The Sand, and All Along The Watchtower (that last one with Chrissie Hynde), the previously unreleased Bluenotes era tune Fool For Your Love; cool stuff. Missing were some great tour favorites such as I Believe In You, Mellow My Mind, Winterlong, Bad Fog Of Loneliness, and World On A String.
I can't say that I have actually listened to this much, nor will I probably listen to it a great deal in the future. But I did very much enjoy listening to Road Rock Volume 1 today.
