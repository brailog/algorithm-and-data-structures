Submit your entry by February 13th, 2009 to:
Mailing Address: ERHS, School Song Lyric Entry, 4200 Pioneer Drive, Woodbury, MN 55029 Email address: ERHSsuggestion@sowashco.k12.mn.us (please scan the entry and attach as image file or PDF to the e‐mail) FAX: (651) 458‐6318
A committee of students, staff, and administration will choose the winning submission. The creator of the winning lyrics will be identified on the sheet music, and will receive an ERHS “pirit Pack”including a sweatshirt, hat, and other items. Some guidelines for your submission:
1) All lyrics must be submitted with words legibly written underneath the printed music of the song (this guarantees that your lyrics match the existing melody). A copy of the song without lyrics is provided on the next page. 2) Specific values, discussed by students, incorporate what the community of East Ridge stands for. These values are: pride, aggressiveness, leadership, respect, brotherhood/sisterhood, strength, enthusiasm, determination, tradition, unity, trust, domination, power, fearlessness, focus, intimidation, intelligence, and awareness. The lyrics should reflect these values. 3) Your lyrics should fit the existing music without rhythmic adaptation. You may add or remove slurs to fit your lyrics. 4) There should be a rhyme scheme evident in your lyrics. 5) Use elements of the ERHS identity, such as “Raptors,” “East Ridge,” “Black and Gold,” and “East Ridge High School.” 6) Try to make your lyrics applicable for many sports and activities (the original lyrics are specific to football).
Judging Criteria: 1) Lyrics fit the rhythmic scheme of the existing melody 2) Lyrics use elements of the ERHS Identity (colors, mascot, title) 3) Lyrics avoid questionable text or double meanings 4) Lyrics are applicable for various sports and activities 5) Lyrics are memorable 6) Lyrics reflect the values of ERHS

Meet The Planning Team
Carolle Neisius is currently a School Counselor at Park High School and will be one of the school counselors at ER. She received her undergraduate degree from the University Wisconsin Stout in Human Development. She worked for a year in that field and returned to UW-Stout to receive her Masters in K-12 Guidance and Counseling. She worked two years at Irondale High School in New Brighton and then went to Park High School where she has been a counselor there for 9 years. Carolle is originally from Wisconsin and a loyal Packer fan. She is from a large family of 14 and grew up on a dairy farm. She came to Minnesota about 11 years ago and currently lives in Inver Grove Heights with her dog Brandi. Carolle is really excited to be coming to East Ridge and to work with the staff and East Ridge families. She is also excited because it is a new building with new faces and it’s a chance to bring unique ideas to the building that will help students and families. The one thing she would like people to know about her is that she really cares about each and every one of her students and she looks forward to working with them.
