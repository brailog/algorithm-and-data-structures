Led by Dr. Bernard Tieger, Bard College (emeritus) Gather on Olin steps at 4:45 Settled about 1715, Tivoli was a ferry landing and produced cloth and bricks. Frenchman Peter de Labigarre platted Tivoli in the 1790s; it never grew much beyond serving as a home to commercial fishermen and railroad workers. The village, incorporated 1872, also produced hats, barrels and boxes. At the end of the 19th century Tivoli began to decline. In very recent years it has drawn many Bard students and others as residents, and has become something of a tourist destination. Our guide will be village historian Dr. Bernard Tieger, proprietor of a popular Tivoli bookstore. After the tour we will enjoy dinner at Tivoli excellent Mexican restaurant.5:00-6:30 Walking Tour of Tivoli

The surveying and granting of public lands; the development of canals, railroads, highways, and public utilities; the evolution of modern school districts; and local contributions to the nation wars are all documented in the Archivesholdings. Folts will provide an overview of records containing information about localities, give examples, and discuss access tools for learning more about the Archivesholdings. Weiss will explain the usefulness of Library holdings, including published series with local data, and the rich collection of manuscripts, maps, and newspapers covering all of New York State.
Led by Cynthia Owen Philip Gather on Olin steps at 3:30 The hamlet of Rhinebeck has been a river, road, and rail transportation hub throughout its history. It was purchased by five Dutchmen in 1688 from the Lenape Indians. Some of their descendants still live there. The oldest house dates from 1701, but most were built with the railroad (1851) or in the 1880s. Join us for a guided look at this community survival and adaptation. Friday 3:30-5:30 Walking Tour of Rhinebeck

The Wendell E. Tripp Lecture in New York State History
Dr. J.A. Jacobs, Universiteit van Amsterdam
In August 1635, New Netherland director Wouter van Twiller and his councilors wrote a letter to their superiors in Holland. The previously unknown letter covers many points from the early history of New Netherland and enables us to come to a different appraisal of van Twiller as director. This event is made possible by the New York Council for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Humanities.A Troubled Man: Wouter van Twiller and New Netherland in 1635
