For lodging, I would suggest trying to reserve 2 days in Mammoth and 3 days near Old Faithful or Lake Yellowstone, if cost is a factor (otherwise perhpas 3 days at Old Faithful and 2 days at Yellowstone Lake). All the lodges are great but Mammoth is cheaper. There are also a great deal of rooms in West Yellowstone.
