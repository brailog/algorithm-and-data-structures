Action
Abana regulates serum lipids by lowering the cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels, and restores the cardioprotective high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level. Abana also reduces platelet aggregation. Moreover, Abana reduces the sensitivity of the heart to adrenergic stimulation. Abana improves the contractility of the heart by exerting a positive inotropic action. Thus Abana produces cardioprotection.
