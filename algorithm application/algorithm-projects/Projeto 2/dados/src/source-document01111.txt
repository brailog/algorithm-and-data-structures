Do you want to be a game tester?   Would you like to get paid to play video games?
If you said "" to these questions then you need our !YES Game Tester Guide
The process of becoming a video game tester is relatively straight forward. In general you need to be over the age of 16 but you do not require any special skills or experience. You will however need a platform to play the games on. This could be a PC, a MAC or a console such as an xbox 360, a PS2 or a Gamecube.
The only difficult part is contacting the right people in the right way. Once you have our guide you will be armed with this knowledge and can start your new job as a video game tester immediately.
When you start with a new company they will send you a copy of the game along with instructions on how long they would like you to play and what feedback they would like from you. The feedback is often in the form of a questionnaire and is quite simple to fill out.
You will then receive payment either by the number of hours played or for each testing project you complete. It's that easy! As a bonus you will also be able to keep the beta version of the game which they sent you, I have managed to build a collection of around 40 xbox 360 games in quite a short time.
