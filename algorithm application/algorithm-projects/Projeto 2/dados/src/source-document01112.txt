Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral that becomes toxic once broken down or disturbed. If broken down the fibers separate and form a dust that can be easily inhaled and ingested. Individuals who breathe in the fibers are at risk of developing an asbestos-caused disease such as mesothelioma, asbestosis or lung cancer.
