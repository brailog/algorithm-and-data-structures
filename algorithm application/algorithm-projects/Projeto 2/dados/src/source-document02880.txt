What is a computer virus?
A computer virus is a computer program that places copies of itself in other programs on your system or somehow manipulates other files on your system, with the express purpose of causing mischief or damage.
Computer viruses are not something that you should ignore, they can do very serious damage to your computer system, from deleting a few files to killing your machine DEAD. If you do not have any kind of antivirus software installed on your system, and if you do, and it is out of date, get some now before it is to late. Do not think it will not happen to you because it will.
