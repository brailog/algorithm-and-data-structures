Using your athletic skills in a job search
As a student-athlete, there will be many demands on your valuable time during your undergraduate career. However, it is never too early to begin thinking about your future and making yourself as marketable as possible when you inevitably enter the world of work. Despite your hectic schedule, you may have opportunities for volunteerism, you could work with the program or get involved with the University's program, which often offers short term commitment opportunities for those looking to give back to their communities but don't seem to be able to find the time to make a long term commitment. In addition to these potential opportunities, you have already developed many skills, and will continue to develop many skills, which employers find valuable in their employees. So don't sell yourself short when preparing for interviews, writing cover letters and formulating your resume. Take the time to highlight these positive qualities and be prepared to transition them from the athletic field to the workplace! Husky Sport Community Outreach
