Euclid's text Elements was the first systematic discussion of geometry.
It has been one of the most influential books in history, as much for its method as for its mathematical content.
The method consists of assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and then proving many other propositions (theorems) from those axioms.
Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier Greek mathematicians, Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could be fitted together into a comprehensive deductive and logical system..
