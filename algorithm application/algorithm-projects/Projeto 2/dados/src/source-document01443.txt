The most common form of trumpet found in the modern age is a Bflat valve trumpet.

Besides the B-flat instrument, other types of trumpets in use today include:

The Trumpet in F - invented by Rimsky-Korsakov and much used by the Russian school of composers i.e. Stravinsky, Shostakovich and Rachmaninov although this particular instrument is probably not used so much in the modern era.
The Bass Trumpet in C - like the Wagner Tuba, this old instrument can be found in a modern orchestra. It was invented by Richard Wagner for the "Ring Cycle" and was used mainly as a doubling instrument. This trumpet is usually played by a trombone player as it is of similar pitch and using a similar mouthpiece. Despite the fact that this bass trumpet can be written for with many crooks, the bass trumpet in C is probably the most commonly used by orchestral players.
