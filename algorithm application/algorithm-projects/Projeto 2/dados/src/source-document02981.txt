Generic, off-the-shelf GPS processing software packages, however, do not take advantage many of the specific algorithmic issues that can be implemented to increase levels of precision to that required for the monitoring of geometrical deformations. When this monitoring takes place in or around steep slopes, syetematic errors such as slope induced multipath can significantly degrade position solutions.  As such, dedicated software is required to exctract the most from the GPS observations.Summary
As a result, a number of application-specific software packages have been developed to target the specific area of GPS positioning for the monitoring of geometrical deformations.
Both the software application GPS Mailbox, and Gather GPS make use of a base called This processing engine offers the following features:Results
