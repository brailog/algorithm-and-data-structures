Stress is a hot topic today, but it is nothing new...it has been recognized for centuries as a health challenge. We are currently acknowledging it's extreme effects on our mind, emotions, and body. It is possible for humans to learn new responses to pressure and change their experiences of it. A person's ability to remain healthy in tense situations is sometimes referred to as stress hardiness. Hardy people have a cluster of personality traits that strengthen their ability to cope. These traits include believing in the importance of what they are doing; believing that they have some power to influence their situation; and viewing life's changes as positive opportunities rather than as threats. Relaxation training, yoga, t'ai chi, dance therapy and prayer and worshcip help patients relieve physical and mental symptoms of strain and tension.
Stress - What Is It?
It's An Old Issue
It can be defined as an individual's physical and mental reaction to environmental demands or pressures.
This psychological condition occurs when individuals feel unable to cope with the demands being made on them. They also believe that this failure will have important consequences. This condition is sometimes called distress, to distinguish it from the positive or pleasant aspects of tense situations (eustress). This strain is usually associated with feeling a lack of control and involvement in the decisions which affect life and work.
