oue invited to the Imagination Institute to attend the "Inventor of the Year" award ceremony, honoring Professor Wayne Zelinski for his amazing achievements in the scientific world. Professor Zelinski will be on hand to speak about his inventions and youl even get a sneak-peak demonstration of his shrinking/enlarging machine, as well as his duplicating machine! An exciting 3-D experience to be sure, so don forget to pick up your safety goggles on the way in. And don worry, the professor, despite his unconventional methods, will be sure to give a fun, informative, glitch-free presentation. His days of good-natured blundering, resulting in the shrinking of his family or even , (giggle), the audience are in the past e hope. So bring the whole family, there plenty of room in the institute for all of you, and get ready for an experience thatl blow your mind .up.
