Diabetes Nutrition Guide
When people think of diabetes, they usually think of that old rule against eating sweets. But today's dietary guidelines have no forbidden foods and make controlling your blood sugar much easier. The guidelines are:
Eat a variety of healthy foods.
Eat smaller amounts of protein foods and fewer high fat foods.
Balance the carbohydrates you eat with insulin.
Exercise
Eating the appropriate amounts of healthy food will keep your weight under control and help manage your diabetes. Your body needs foods from the four main food groups every day:
Fruits and vegetables (oranges, apples, bananas, carrots, and spinach)
Whole grains, cereals, and bread  (wheat, rice, oats, bran, and barley)
Dairy products (whole or skim milk, cream, and yogurt)
Meats, fish, poultry, eggs, dried beans, and nuts.
