RV / Marine Solar Power Up Kits
Solar Powering your RV or boat is easy with ETA Engineering. Our all-in-one Power Up family of photovoltaic charging system kits are all you need to charge the batteries in your Recreational Vehicles (RV) or boat. By including an optional, properly sized inverter system and deep-cycle battery bank to your kit, you can easily supply 120 Volts AC electricity (the same as at home) to your RV or boat's electrical systems.
        
Why use a noisy generator that constantly needs to be refueled, when the sun can power your equipment with significantly less maintenance?
The components included with each system are offered at ETA's "Kit" price. The "Kit" price offers a discount over the total "Retail" price of the components when purchased as a system. All modules come with a 20 or 25 year warranty. All ETA Engineering charge controllers come with a 5 year warranty.  The systems listed on this page are designed to charge 12-volt, deep-cycle battery banks and have photovoltaic array peak output ratings ranging from 80 Watts up to 240 Watts. All systems are shippable by United Parcel Service.
          
We offer free technical assistance, by phone and/or e-mail, to our customers performing their own installations.
