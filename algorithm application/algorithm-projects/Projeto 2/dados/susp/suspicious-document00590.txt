Our work is guided by the most basic of rehabilitation values, that first and foremost, persons with psychiatric disabilities have the same goals and dreams as any other person. Our mission is to increase the likelihood that they can achieve these goals by improving the effectiveness of people, programs, and service systems. The first step in rehabilitating a child is to provide a team of pediatric rehabilitation specialists who understand the physical, emotional, and psychological needs of children at different stages of life. The specialists include audiologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, and/or speech language pathologists. After a comprehensive evaluation, a
treatment plan is developed with the child's family to enable patients to reach their maximum level of functional ability as quickly as possible. A select team of pediatric specialists Rehabilitative Services evaluate and treat a variety of medical and developmental diagnoses and conditions such as:Pediatric-Specific Rehabilitative Services The first reason is that you do not want to sustain further injury to that area. The second is because to heal itself your body needs rest.R = REST Ice bags, cold packs, frozen peas all work well wrapped in a damp thin towel. Cold provides short-term pain relief as well as reducing swelling. Do not ice for more than 15-20 minutes at a time.I = ICE Compression will limit the swelling which would have slowed down the healing process. Wrap the injured area with an elastic
bandage, rewrap more loosely if throbbing occurs.C = COMPRESSION Elevating the body part reduces swelling.E = ELEVATION After a day or two of most injuries have begun to heal. If you do not have a decrease in pain or swelling you may need to go to your physician and also request a referral to see a physiotherapist.R.I.C.E.

collar
bone) resulting in compression of the nerves
and blood vessels that supply the arm. Signs and symptoms of TOS usually include pain in the neck and shoulder area and pain or pins and needles with or without numbness and weakness in the arm/hand. There are various factors that may lead to the development of TOS. It generally occurs in middle-aged women and
almost always on one side of the body.

Done at the City of Washington, this nineteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States the eighty-fifth. The colorful stories about Lincoln's life really are true: He was born in a log cabin and grew up on the American frontier, educated himself by reading borrowed books, and worked
splitting fence rails and clerking in a general store, and then as a country lawyer, long before he became president. He served in the Illinois General Assembly for eight years and in the U.S. House of Representatives for one term (1847-49) before his election as the nation's first Republican president in 1860. As president he is best remembered for leading the Union through the Civil War and freeing Confederate slaves with the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation; for delivering the Gettysburg Address, the most famous oration in American history, on 19 November 1863; and for his tragic assassination by at Ford's Theater in Washington, D.C.

Noyes of Sportsmetrics   Are you at risk for a knee injury? The Sports Injury Test measures several important factors such as an athlete's strength, coordination and body alignment. This compilation of tests compares the athlete's performance to a large research database of over 800 female athletes. The database is used to understand factors which may predispose an athlete to injury. Intertester reliability generally was poor, with ICCvalues of .41 for subjects without LBP and .50 for subjectswith LBP. The results suggest that measurements of lumbar lordosiswith a flexible rule may be reliable if taken by the same
physicaltherapist. The degree of
reliability, however, may vary fromtherapist to therapist. The intertester reliability of thesemeasurements appears to be poor, but these conclusions mustbe interpreted carefully because of the limited number of therapistsparticipating in this study.

W Personius, PhD, is Associate Professor, Department of Physical Therapy, School of Allied Health Professions, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University. The purpose of this study was to examine the intratester andintertester reliability of lumbar lordosis measurements takenwith a flexible rule. Two physical therapists (Tester 1 andTester 2) took measurements on 40 subjects without low backpain (LBP) and on 40 subjects with LBP. Intraclass correlationcoefficients (ICCs) were used to determine the degree of agreementbetween repeated measurements taken by the same therapist andbetween measurements
taken by the two therapists. The ICC valuesfor intratester reliability of Tester 1 were .84 for subjectswithout LBP and .94 for subjects with LBP. The President then proceeded to Frederick, where he was received by the people with the most enthusiastic demonstrations of respect, and reached Washington in a special train at ten o’clock at night.

Albumen print photograph by Alexander Gardner.President Lincoln on Battle-Field of Antietam Share Stroke is literally a "brain attack", caused when the vital supply of blood and oxygen is cut off to part of the brain. New emergency methods for diagnosing and treating acute stroke have recently become available. Immediate medical care, including new methods of stroke diagnosis and drugs for emergency treatment of stroke, can minimize brain damage and dramatically increase a person's chance of recovery after a stroke. However, many people at risk of stroke still do not
realize that stroke is an emergency and if treated immediately massive disability can be avoided. More serious pathologies which can present with thoracic outlet syndrome type symptoms must be ruled out before any form of treatment begins. Osteopathy can play a significant role in the assessment, diagnosis and management of TOS. As part of the management plan the aim is to relieve the compression of the nerves and blood vessels within the thoracic outlet thus relieving and minimising pain. At Miami Children's Hospital, a full range of bilingual diagnostic and therapeutic services is available to meet the needs of infants, children, and adolescents. All services are performed by a team of professionals who focus on the medical, therapeutic, and educational needs of the child. Miami Children's Hospital's rehabilitative
setting includes the neonatal intensive care unit, inpatient hospitalization areas, and an outpatient rehabilitation department. whiplash or broken collar bone; congenital anomalies (cervical rib); poor posture (ie rounded or drooping shoulders) and heavy lifting. Thoracic outlet syndrome may be associated with certain occupations that involve working in a prolonged static position such as driving, desk work or playing a musical instrument such as the violin. Along with STR therapy, motivated clients are given homework to do, i.e., (AIS). Assuredly, soreness, swelling, and pain relate to a loss of tissue movement. So that the muscles, fascia (connective tissue), and joints need to maintain maximum movement to help prevent postural changes, disease, and injury. A decrease in flexibility normally accompanies aging and is caused by a failure to maintain movement through a complete range of motion. The primary determinants of
flexibility
are the fascia and musculature surrounding a specific joint. If the muscles and tendons are required to elongate on a regular basis, the joint will maintain a normal level of flexibility. Active Isolated Stretching AIS is recommended to willing clients (when the client wants to begin learning them). AIS focuses on specific
muscles
in the body that exist in a state of contraction. The President reached General Sumner’s headquarters, on Bolivar Heights, at Harper’s Ferry, on Wednesday, occupied the afternoon in reviewing the forces at that position, and spent the night at general Sumner’s quarters. On Thursday morning he recrossed the Potomac, and was met by General McClellan and Staff, who conducted him during that the following day over the scenes of the recent battle, and in reviewing the various quarters, occupying much of the time in private conversation with him.

If it is difficult for the subject to fully straighten their legs, an assistant may be used to help press the legs down by applying pressure above or below the knees. The subject then reaches slowly forward, the fingertips of both hands remaining in contact with the slide at all
