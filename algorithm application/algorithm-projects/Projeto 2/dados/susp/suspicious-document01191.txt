The use by prison inmates of mobilephones is a common issue and the reluctance to use jammers is another. ummm sorry? Since I'm not part of the "establishment" I get to engage in in strange and fun things. In the past few years we've shot standard home wireless dozens of miles. We've intercepted telemetry signals from great distances. Mapped large regions quickly for wireless and also reverse mapped. Which is kind of fun. We do some pretty crazy stuff but I also have a well stocked wireless laboratory (equipment) and the work force (students) to do stuff. Technology has brought us all together, but will it lift us up? The Interconnected Age has put every person within your reach, but that doesn’t mean people will instantly take action for problems you want them to solve. While many people are talking about cause marketing, not many can tell you what it [...] Posts Tagged ‘history of communication’ by Scott Henderson Two Things You Need to Know from This Post: We advise on the social and economic impacts of

Hawking Technologies' H-AI6SI
(Single Band 802.11b and
802.11g) Wireless Antenna boosts your wireless signal strength from 2dB (standard) to 6dB! As an
omni-directional antenna, this unit increase the strength in all directions.   OutDoor Antenna Kits: H-AO8SI is one of Hawking's Hi-Gain 24 series, 2.4 GHz Wireless Antenna Line.The Outdoor Omni-Directional Antenna emits a powerful amplified signal over a 360 degree radius, delivering a strong multi- direction signal from an Access Point or a Bridge.The H-AO8SI also comes with a mounting kit, connectors, and a surge protector. Dektronix Inc. One of the major problems with many wireless networks is the poor coverage area of standard
access points and wireless routers. When combined with
two directional antennas
directed toward each other, your
wireless range may be extended up to
2750ft. Hawking Technology
HAI15SC, 2.4GHz Hi-Gain Wireless Corner Antenna, boosts your
wireless signal strength from 2dBi
(standard) to 15dBi! The Hi-Gain Corner Antenna is the
perfect solution for providing Wireless coverage in very large rooms, conference halls or buildings. The high power level of the antenna ensures that every corner of your application will be covered. The Hi-Gain Corner Antenna has been specifically designed for easy installation in the corner of a wall.

eventual uses, and to fit into their proper places. Even many speculations seemingly remote, turn out to be the basis of results the most obviously practical. In the case of

And had not mathematicians toiled for
so long, and, to
uninstructed observers, apparently so
fruitlessly, over the abstract relations of lines and surfaces, it is probable that but few of our mechanical inventions would have seen the light. However, the shorter the total cable length is, the stronger signal the antenna
will have. The H-AO14SD
Outdoor Directional Antenna Kit is currently the  strongest Hi-Gain antenna. When paired with another Hi-Gain antenna it is capable of extending your wireless range up to one and a half mile. The directional design of the antenna creates a 30 degree emission of your highly amplified wireless signal. The Kit includes the outdoor antenna, mounting kit, weather-proof taping and SMA connector cable. In order to successfully install the antenna, one must purchase either the 10ft(H-AC10N) or 30 ft(H-AC30N) outdoor antenna cable. Our Best Selling Wireless Adapter!!!!

Even while wearing appropriate safety equipment, an aircannon can still be very hazardous. Paintball goggles are meant to protect against one or two pellet impacts, not 30, 40, or more simultaneously. In my experience (and this will very with each particular air cannon and type of cartridge) anything under 50-60 feet is just too close. Preferred method of use for paintball is lobbing the paint into the air so that it spreads
and rains down over a
large area, thus marking as many people as possible. Using a GPS receiver, he recorded potato halves flying over 300 meters. I don't mind answering questions about aircannons, but please, before you ask, read the web site thoroughly. Chances are, based on much of the mail I receive, your question is answered here. Don't miss the Frequently Asked Questions further down this page: There have been several air cannon type devices used in the sport of paintball (what's Paintball?

The Command Post had a small unit
that worked off of 12 gram CO2 cartridges. Some other
company came out with the "Thud
Gun", and another made the Air
Power Sabot Cannon. Reception area covers a wide direction, East to West 20 degrees, allowing coverage of BS at 110 degrees east longitude, to CS at 144 degrees east longitude. Beam direction is controlled by a beam forming circuit. A corresponding number of these beam forming circuits will enable simultaneous reception from satellites located in different directions. A flat antenna is formed by arranging many small antenna elements.

my aircannon works just fine on DC, and has for years. Theory and conjecture are very valuable, but they
can fall flat on their face
in light of real world evidence. Perhaps I shouldn't have changed majors from EE to broadcasting after all. Ever seen a car with automatic door locks? Those solenoids are operated on the car's DC current too.The valves I saw were listed for AC use, where can I get
a DC valve? - One. Really though in a paintball game,
there's rarely a chance to shoot a whole group of people more than once in a game, so it's no big deal.How many shots do you get per charge of the air chamber?" The Ministry is required to report to the Minister of Communications annually on the comparative
