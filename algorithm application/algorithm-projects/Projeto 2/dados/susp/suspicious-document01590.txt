The Drake family has influenced the business community in Franklin since
1954, when Clyde Drake, father of the current owner, Phil Drake, opened what would soon become a successful tax preparation business. The younger Drake started developing tax preparation software in the 1970s. In 1977, he decided to discontinue preparing tax returns, and instead focus his energy on tax software. That year, Phil made the
decision not to compete with tax preparers, a choice that continues to impact the direction of the company to this day. When the IRS implemented a new program for electronically filing individual and business tax returns in 1986, Phil soon began using the new technology, transmitting some of the first electronically filed tax returns in North Carolina. To do a split refund, you'll have to follow a few rules and fill out Form 8888, Direct Deposit of Refund to More Than One Account, available on the page of the IRS Web site. Forms and Publications Interestingly, while split refunds can only be done through electronic funds transfers, you don't have to file your tax form electronically to use them. But I recommend you try filing electronically anyway. The IRS reports that electronically-filed forms contain fewer errors than paper forms, and generate refunds about two weeks faster. • • • • US News Tax Rankings • • • • • • • • • Course Materials • • Audio Excerpts of Oral Arguments • • • • Charts of Tax Cases • • • • Bush, Clinton, Bush, Reagan • Ford, Nixon, FDR Grant Opportunities • SSRN Tax Papers
