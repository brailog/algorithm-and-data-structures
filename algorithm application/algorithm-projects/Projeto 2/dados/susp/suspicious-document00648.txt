readers to believe that Chiapas and rural Mexico are highly dangerous, unhealthy and precarious areas, unsuitable for living let alone traveling. I don't mean to say that the Mexico
described by Barton is
nonexistent. Yet, I do feel the need to point out that there also IS another Mexico.... () Letter from more Robert Rivas-Bastedas  San Cristobal de las Casas: What About Living There? . The city is truly a jewel. It's peaceful and offers all modern conveniences. It's relatively
well connected and will be even more in the near future with two new roads under construction (Tuxtla-San Cristobal and Tuxtla-Mexico City)..... There

school that warmly welcomes foreign children. Throughout the Pyramid Mountains south of Lordsburg can be found specimens of bornite, lead, linerite, azurite and many other
minerals. The former mining towns of Valedon,
Pyramid, and Shakespeare (now a preserved ghost town) are examples of former towns that owed
their existence to mining in the Pyramid Mountains. Most
mines in this area produced lead, copper, and gold. At the Apache Mine, located southeast of Hachita, can be found a wide array of interesting specimens. Azurite, chrysocolla, malachite, calcite, turquoise, fluorite, pyrite, and garnet are some examples of what can be found in this mineral-rich
area. Other
sites popular with rock hounders are the Coronado National Forest in the extreme southern end of the county, famous for its geodes and Apache tears, Skeleton Canyon, known for its agates and rhyolite, Granite Gap, with its fields of quartz and abandoned lead, zinc, and silver
mines, and Redrock, known for its fine specimens of ricolite. For many years, Lordsburg was
the site of the annual Rockamania event, a gem and mineral show that was extremely popular with rock collectors from all over the country.

Interim Port Director Michael DeBruhl, Hidalgo Port of
Entry, “Our officers’ alertness greatly contributed
in preventing this currency from being exported, in violation of federal currency reporting requirements.” It is not a crime to carry more than $10,000, but it is a
federal offense not to declare currency or monetary instruments totaling $10,000 or more to a CBP officer upon entry or exit from the U.S. or to conceal it with intent to evade reporting requirements. Failure to declare may result in seizure of the currency and/or arrest. An individual may petition for the return of currency
seized by CBP officers, but the petitioner must prove that the source and intended use of the currency was legitimate. U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the unified border agency within the

that plunge through dense forest in an impossibly precarious series of curves and switchbacks that make the journey itself an adventure. The ample Pacific coastline provides an
opportunity to escape the crowds on the tranquil beach of Mazunte or head to the busy seaside town of Puerto Escondido. Dolphins, turtles and many types of birds can
be spotted at various points along the Oaxacan coast. The ancient city of Palenque offers some of the finest Mayan architecture Mexico has to
offer. A large, sprawling site including domestic, official and
religious buildings that are surrounded by dense tropical forest, Palenque offers an immersive archaeological
experience that is only rivalled by nearby
Tikal
in Guatemala.Palenque The nearby ruins of Yaxchilan and Bonampak are also worth a visit and can be accessed by a trip down the Usamacinta River. Department of Justice
(DOJ) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sent agents to Mexico to find Aldrete-Davila to offer him immunity
and free medical care and to bring him back to testify against agents Compean and Ramos. The DOJ and DHS officials helped Aldrete-Davila launch a lawsuit for $5 million dollars against the Border Patrol.Whereas: During the trial, while waiting to testify against agents
Compean and Ramos,
Aldrete-Davila was arrested for attempting
to bring another load of drugs into the United States of America. The prosecutors set him
free and suppressed this information so it wouldn't
harm the case against agents Compean and Ramos by prosecutor
Debra Kanof, Judge Kathleen Cardone and the Department of Homeland Security.Whereas: Border Patrol Agents Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos were convicted of a crime through lies told at their trial by drug smuggler Osbaldo Alrete-Davila. Agent Compean was sentenced to eleven years in jail, and agent Ramos was sentenced to twelve years. On January 17, 2007, these
agents began serving their prison sentences.Whereas: The Federal Court trial of agents Compean and Ramos has all the ear markings of a frame up, in
order to send a loaded message to other Border Patrol Agents, that if you confront smugglers, you will get what happened to agents
Compean and Ramos.Whereas: Worse, by all appearances the
armed men were Mexican
military. It remains to be seen whether these men were operating with
the blessings of the Mexican government. Were they part of Los Zetas, or were they regular Mexican military? No one here yet knows. As the Mexican drug cartels grow bolder due to our ineffectiveness, the
likelihood of open conflict grows stronger. Unless action is taken quickly, we will see a bloody confrontation along our border. On top of everything Ie mentioned
above, Mexico receives millions of American taxpayer
dollars each year in foreign aid. I like to propose a better way to spend that money. Let dump our atch and releasepolicy regarding illegal aliens and stop sending any foreign aid to Mexico. Use the money instead to build prisons in the Southern US
to hold the
illegals. Let require that convicted illegals spend a minimum of two years behind bars on the first offense. Oh sure, the liberals here and
around the world would scream bloody murder about it. Much has been written
over the last few years about our problems with Mexico. Illegal drugs, illegal immigrants, tax fraud, job loss and the unpaid medical bills of illegals have placed a
huge burden on American taxpayers. Along with American
jobs flowing southward into Mexico, more
American jobs are lost as illegal Mexican immigrants
flow northward to be hired by unscrupulous
employers on our own soil. In spite of this one-two punch, our dynamic economy has thus far prevented a catastrophic unemployment rate. But good economies come and go, and sooner or later wel see a downturn. What then? If these crooks are hiring cheap illegal labor while the
economy is good, what are the chances of them hiring you or me when the economy begins to
slow? Responding to the urgent need for revenue following the , the First passed and President signed the Tariff Act of , , which authorized the

Pacific Ocean coastline rise quickly into the foothills of the mountains, while the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean coastlines are wider and rise gently into the interior. The mountainous Baja Peninsula extends about 750 miles () south from the U.S. border. Mexico's limestone Yucatan Peninsula is tree-covered, with thick tropical jungles along it borders with Central America countries. Mexico has nearly 150 rivers; most are
small, unnavigable, and 70% drain into the
Pacific Ocean; some of the large rivers
include the Balsas, Conchos, Grijalva, Panuco, Papaloapan, Usumacinta. () The Rio Grande, rising in the San Juan Mountains of the U.S. State of Colorado, flows generally south to the Gulf of Mexico for 1,885 miles (3,000 km), and forms much of Mexico
northern border with the United States.
