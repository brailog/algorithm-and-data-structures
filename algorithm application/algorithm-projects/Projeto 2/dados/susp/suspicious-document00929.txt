Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is poised to become the speaker of the House of Representatives in January. That the concern is about her politics, and not her gender, is a welcome sign of how much things have changed in recent decades, albeit slowly. While nearly 85 percent of the nation's workers need automobiles to get to their jobs, four of every five rush-hour commuters to New York City's central business district avoid traffic congestion by taking transit service  most of it operated by the MTA. MTA customers travel on America's largest bus fleet and on more subway and rail cars than all the rest of the country's subways and commuter railroads combined. It is impossible to place a dollar figure on the MTA's land, equipment, and facilities, located on or under some of the world's most expensive real estate. But the greatest value of
the
MTA lies in its beneficial impact on the New York region's economy and quality of life. New York ranks near the top among the nation's best cities for business, Fortune magazine has written, because it has what every city desires.   EVENTS BY BUILDINGS, TENTS, & AREAS Building A   Vendors Building B   Workshops     Book Signing by Authors (Sunday) Building C   Children’s Activities     “Mad Science” presents “Open an Oyster”     Corn Husk Doll Making with Donna Coan     Party Carnival – Children’s Entertainment     Girl Scouts – Hands-On Crafts     Trading Post Products     Balloon Sculpturing     Hay Maze     Putt, Putt Golf     Sheep Toss     Wood Carvers     Angora Rabbit Demonstrations Building D   Halloween Haunted House Building E   ATM Machine
