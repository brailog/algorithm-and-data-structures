Attitude is another important element. Employers look for people who are zestful
and willing to work. Prior to the job fair as well as the interview, be sure to plan ahead if who are the employers you want to work for. Dressing up for the fair or the interview is a helpful tip. Dress professionally and do not wear too much make up. Dress up in a conservative but decent way. Do not be too conscious and just carry your self with the confidence needed. Ask the interviewer to clarify fuzzy questions. Don't interrupt the interviewer. If you don't listen, the interviewer won't either. Don't be overly familiar, even if the interviewer is. Don't ramble. Overlong answers may make you sound apologetic or indecisive. Don't lie. Answer questions truthfully. Don't express resentment. Avoid derogatory remarks about present or former employers.
Don't wear heavy perfume /cologne. The interviewer may not share your tastes. Closing the Interview Job candidates often second-guess themselves after interviews. Usually a member of the personnel department or an outside recruiter conducts this interview, which is meant to weed out unqualified candidates. This interview is often done over the phone. It focuses on clarifying and confirming the qualifications on your resume. Initial Interview The initial interview is conducted by someone from the human resources department. They figure out if you fit the job description and can do the job. They will then determine whether to pass you on to the hiring manager.
